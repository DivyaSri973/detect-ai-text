Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again. If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them. In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it. be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person. Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things. Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are. being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you. could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it. BE SOMEONE BEYOND OF OTHERS CUZ YOU GOT IT\n",

      "Error processing text: A student's freedom from the limitations of the classroom's necessary rules during the summer provides new opportunities for them to learn in dynamic ways. While, in the classroom, a teacher's control of a regulated learning program is unavoidable in order to teach such a broad audience in such a short time, there are no such factors outside the classroom. The variable shape of a student's summer project provides a unique opportunity for the student's specific educational needs to be accounted for which a teacherdesigned project wouldn't be able to take advantage of. Education during the summer should be studentdesigned, because the student can pander to their learning style and interest, it can reinvigorate the student with a passion for learning, and it instills a certain independence from adult figures that will be necessary later in life. Students learn in many different ways. Psychological studies have shown that there are different types of learning, from spacial to audio to visual, and students learn better in some ways than others. A rising awareness of mental health has also led to the understanding that brains process information in different ways, so students with autism or ADHD don't get the same results from the conventional classroom practices. Studentdesigned summer projects would be able to take all these different specifications into account when structuring the project, so visual learners could visit exhibitions while attention deficient kids could apply whatever technique they need to help them study listening to music for some, a totally still room for others. The dynamic nature of a studentdesigned project would be an advantage to the kids who need to learn in a different way from the regulated, cookiecutter methods that teachers use. As well, a studentdesigned project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it. A studentdesigned summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves. Going through a program that teaches them in a way that they both understand and enjoy would be exciting and possibly life changing. The modern school system is the most monstrous source of stress on the childhood and adolescent mind. Even though learning should be acknowledged as a privilege, wonder, and necessity, it becomes a burden to students. Between the forced socialization of the classroom environment, administrations that care more for policy than the experience of the individual, a constantly building workload, and a set of rules and grades that are constantly judging and disciplining behavior, schooling becomes nightmarish for students. The poor environment weighs so heavily on the minds of children that they often develop mental illnesses or complexes, and, in extreme cases, are driven to suicide over poor grades which, in the grand scheme of life, should be menial. Studentdesigned summer projects would be a way to show students that learning can be a growing and nurturing experience, instead of a murderous one. That change in outlook in the mind of a student could make all the difference in that student's optimism, well being, and quality of life for the rest of their schooling career. One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A studentdesigned summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the timemanaging aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them. Forcing a student to design a project that they then have to complete would be an introduction into the decision making of adulthood. A studentdesigned summer project would help students grow, because they could change their views on the operations of education in the span of a few months. They would grow to be stronger learners, more persistent observers, and more assertive leaders. Since life is really a process of learningwhether that means learning skills, academics, or something else entirelyan easy relationship with the concept of learning is the most valuable thing for a person to develop. Studentdesigned projects are an easy opportunity to encourage and teach that kind of relationship, and students would develop an outlook on learning that would improve the way they interact with the world for the rest of their lives.\n",

      "Error processing text: The Electoral College is a process that has been used in the United States Government for many years. It is the process that selects a candidate for Presidency based on electoral votes rather than the popular vote of the people. Many believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, but if we were to take it out of our governmental system, it would take away most of the effectiveness of our elections. The United States election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process of election, it is very effective for choosing a candidate, and when it comes down to it, the last process of the Electoral College House of Representatives stepping in when there is a tie is very unbiased and is also effective in choosing a candidate. If we were to abolish the Electoral College, the United States government would basically be starting over with their election process, which isn't necessarily a good idea once you are nearly 300 years into being an official country. The United states election process has worked very effectively with the Electoral College for a large amount of years. There is no reason why it should be abolished from the country. Throughout all of these elections, the best candidate was chosen for each presidency in the end because of this great process of election. Rather than choosing the majority of the people, which could have a biased opinion, it is left up to both the citizens and a vote in Congress. This forms a balance between the two opinions. It is a very evenly based system, as said in Source 3 In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our deprived methods of choosing the President, the article states that The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. This means that just by having one region of the United States really respect you and vote for you, this does not mean you are going to win the election. No region can get you the win. There simply are not enough electoral votes. Therefore, you must cover the most ground possible in the United States, because the more states you win over, the better your chances of becoming president are. The Electoral College is a very efficient process of election. Instead of only the people voting and the decision of who becomes president left to the popular vote, the power of selection for presidency is evenly spread between Congress and the people. Some say that the electoral college is unfair, and that it is irrational. This is stated in the article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer. He states The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. This means Plumer believes that those who argue in favor of the electoral collegee do not take a look at the reality of things when talking about this subject. The electoral collegee is very fair when it comes to the election of a president, because we all want to choose the best candidate for the job, and the only way to do that is to have an effective system for choosing a candidate without having a biased opinion tossed into the mix to mess up the process. It's sort of like a job interview. You show what you have to offer to the boss in this case it is the whole country, and if you are chosen for the job that means you were the most qualified and that you are the best choice for the job. Whichever candidate gets chosen for the job was obviously the best candidate at the time, and there is nothing that anyone can do to change that. The one situation that most people worry about within the electoral collegee is when there is a tie in the electoral vote. In this situation, the decision of the election would be placed into the hands of the House of Representatives and the Senate chooses the VicePresidential candidate best suited for the job. It does not matter how many representatives there are for any one state, as stated in the article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. He states that Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, representing 35 million voters. This means that no state has more power than another in this process, and every representative has the same amount of power when it comes down to chooosing a candidate best suited for being president. Additionally, it creates a sense of balance between all of the states and nobody has an unfair advantage when electing the next president. As you can see, the electoral collegee is a very effective process used in the United States to choose a presidential candidate that should not be abolished from the country. With this system, the country has functioned very effectively for a very long time, the system is very effective for choosing a candidate best suited for the presidential position, and it is very unbiased and fair when it comes down to the decision of the House of Representatives for the election. Abolishing this efficient process would just do a disservice to the country's election process, and I highly doubt that any wholehearted citizen of the United States of America would want to do that to his or her own home country.\n",

      "Error processing text: The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote. The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an uptodate election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, What Is the Electoral College, written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method. Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a nondemocratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote. Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote. In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.\n",

I'm so nervous about high school and I have a lot of questions. What if I get lost on the first day? What sports do they have? What if my teachers don't like me? Are the teachers nice or mean? Is their a lot of homework? Are phones allowed? asks Generic_Name. Generic_Name! Calm down, high school is not that bad as everyone says it is. Yes, it is bigger than middle school and you have more things to do but it is better, I promise. Now, take a chill pill and stop worrying so much. You still have a couple more months of middle school left,so just focus and enjoy them. Thank you for the advice Generic_Name, I really appreciate it. Generic_Name responds. Anytime you need something just let me know says Generic_Name. Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because you have more options, everyone does different things, and you are able to talk to new people. Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because you have more options. I know you are probably confused by that but what I mean is not everyone is the same. People have different perspectives on different things. If you want to try out for a sport, awesome! But wait..what do you have to do? You go and ask someone named Generic_Name, who is a cheerleader, what the things are required to try out. She says you need a form signed by a parent, your concussion training,and the sport you want to do. Hang on... what sport do you want to do again? You ask someone named Generic_Name, who is a sophomore that has been on the volleyball team since freshman year, what sports your local high school has. She responds with basketball,football. baseball,wrestling,soccer, cheer leading,track,volleyball,golfing,and swimming. You've never tried basketball before so you're interested in it. You try out and you end up not liking it, at least you have other choices to decide from, right? Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because everyone does different things. Generic_Name does cheer leading, Generic_Name does volleyball, and Generic_Name does track. As you can see, no one does the same sport. They all do different sports because they believe whatever sport they do fits them. Just because your friend,Generic_Name, tries out for soccer doesn't mean you have to. Find a sport that you like and a sport that suits you and stick with it. Do a sport that you've never done before and see where it takes you. If you only do it for a season, that's fine. Try out again in the next season if you want to. Unless you want to try out for a different sport. You could be a cheerleader like Generic_Name, or a volleyball player like Generic_Name. Do you want to run the 100 meter like Generic_Name? Everyone does different sports because they like to do it and they have other options just like you. Seeking multiple opinions can give you a better choice because you are able to talk to new people. Let's say that you are new to a school and you want to be able to make friends. You try out for the volleyball team and you end up liking it and you make it! You meet so many new people that become your friends and they give you tips and tricks to fix your mistakes. Not only do they help you, but you also help them. If they give you advice, you can give them advice and help them out as well. Volleyball is great and you are so happy you tried out for the team because you didn't just form a bond with new people, you also found a sport that you love and it suits you. Hey!

I'm so nervous about high school, I don't know what to do. Relax, I can help you. What are you so nervous about? responds Generic_Name. Generic_Name replies, I have a lot of questions like is their a lot of homework? What if I get lost on the first day? Are phones allowed? Are the teachers nice or mean? Generic_Name is stunned. First thing you need to do is take a chill pill because I don't see why you're so nervous about high school. It's not that scary as they exaggerate in the movies. They have orientation so you can see your classes and not get lost. You are able to have your phone out in the hallways and at lunch. The teachers are nice unless you get on their badside, and you don't have alot of homework. Wow, thank you Generic_Name, I feel better already. I knew I could help Generic_Name responds.

      "Error processing text: Mom, Generic_Name whimpered sadly. Why is it so hard to make friends in school? Her mother moves slowly towards the edge of her daughters bed and grabs her hand. Now sweetie, her mother says comfortingly. I'm sure if you tried hard enough you could make friends with someone. Crying softly Generic_Name turns toward her mother and says angrily, It's not that easy mom! I don't have anything to talk about with these people. We don't even like the same things! sighing her mother pulls her in for a hug, oh honey, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. Generic_Name's mother can't do anything but rock her sobbing child as she cries . This is a sad reality for many kids, throughout all stages of schooling, they have difficulties making friends and often end up feeling isolated and lonely. This problem can be easily solved by school principals requiring students participate in at least one extracurricular activity like a club or a sport. These extracurricular activities would help encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue a passion or hobby, and give each other opportunities to learn more about themselves while expressing their personal interests and talents. The first reason schools should make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they would encourage students to be more social with their peers. As a student with social anxiety I know how difficult it can be to try and talk to people and make friends, but in my experience i've noticed that clubs and sports give students more confidence in themselves. An extracurricular activity, whether it be a sport or a club, is an effective and easy way for a student to put them self out there with people who share their interests. For example when I first started school it was hard for me to talk to people and I didn't have many friends, then one day my language arts teacher encouraged me to try out for our school track team. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a chance, and it ended up being one of the smartest decisions I had made that year. After making the team I steadily came more and more out of my shell with the motivation of my teammates. I built strong friendships with many of the girls on my team solely because of the interest that bonded us together, our love for running. Joining track made me more confident in myself, and taught me how to make and maintain unbreakable friendships. My second piece of reasoning as to why schools should require extracurricular activities, is because they would urge students to try new things and become interested in different hobbies. During the years students are in school, their hobbies are constantly evolving at a rapid pace, and they often become interested in things they had never acknowledged before. This example is true to many people, including myself. After track season had ended I decided I wanted to join an after school club, but none of the options really caught my eye. After searching for awhile a friend from the track team asked if I would be interested in joining our school robotics club as her teammate. As I had no other options that jumped out to me, I decided to try joining. Since joining the club in my sixth grade year I've developed a passion for engineering and computer programming that I never would have imagined developing otherwise. Taking that one chance to join the club has turned my previous skills and new ideas into a passion I doubt I'll ever lose. The final reason that extracurricular activities should be required is that being in a club or sport would assist students in discovering more about themselves. In many cases people find out new things about themselves while participating in a club. It could be simple things such as unknown talents, or as complicated as realizing their social position on a team. When I first joined robotics in my sixth grade year, I was what you would describe as a follower. But when our team captain was out because of a concussion and my team was falling apart, we found out that I was, as described by my coach, A natural born leader. Even being the unsociable person I am, I was able to lead my team with no assistance for three weeks, with a strength I wasn't sure I had. After this discovery I was promoted by my coach to be a team captain. For the last three years I have been the captain of my team, and as this is my final year considering I'm an eighth grader, my coach decided to test my skills. The past four months I have been captain and supervisor of three different teams by his order. I realize as I look back I never would have learned this about myself without joining robotics club. MOM! Elise shouts excitedly as she rushes through the front door, WE WON! from her place in the kitchen her mother lets out a whoop of surprise before running to join her daughter in the living room. Surrounded by her teammates Elise holds the 1st place trophy up proudly as she laughs. The house is filled with the joyous laughter of Elise and her friends from the soccer club. As the girls chat between themselves Elise's mother looks on with a smile, proud of her daughter for finding friends that made her happy. Making eye contact with Elise she shouts, All right, Group picture! Lining up with large smiles on their faces and arms around each other, the girls look into the camera with happiness evident on their faces. The snap of the camera ensures this memory will always have a special place in Elise's heart. Without having joined an extracurricular activity Elise would never have had the opportunity to make the bonds and friendships she did. Being in a club or sport helps encourage students to be more social with their peers, pursue new hobbies, and give each other opportunities to learn more about themselves and express their interests. Reasons such as these are why I agree that principles at all schools should make the decision requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity.\n",

      "Error processing text: Extracurricular activities are necessary for the growing mind of the adolescence. Children, from a young age, should learn how to work with others so that, in the future, they can work with others to get their necessary work done. Children will also benefit from participating in extracurricular activities because it helps them gain better communicating, and social skills that helps them excel in the future. They should also participate, for then they can meet new people of different ages and make new friends that will be there for them through thick and thin. These are the reasons why I believe students should participate in extracurricular activities. Participating in extracurricular activities provide a safe environment to learn how to work with others in a fun and productive way. When children of all ages learn how to work with others of different ages, they gain a necessary skill of communicating with others in a way they can get work done. For example, in the construction industry, adults have to figure out how, when, and who will work of certain parts of a major project because if they do not, nothing will get done and would put others in danger because the building was not built properly. It is also necessary to lean how to work with others, even if they do not get along. Learning how to work with others at a young age is extremely important because the young adolescences are oozing hormones that puts them through emotional stress and discomfort. Many students find it hard to work with others because they do not know how to properly communicate with others to complete projects. If children participate in extracurricular activities, they would learn how to communicate properly with their peers and friends to receive amazing grades for all their hard work. Learning how to work with others is an important skill, especially if they are of different ages. when to kids have to work with one another, they would want to work with someone of the same age or grade. When kids grow up, after only working with those of the same age, they will not excel work because they can't work well with those of different ages, they will gradually find ways to work with them efficiently, but this forced change will not be to their benefit nor will this change be fast. The adolescence mind is still in the growing process, it is the best time to give proper schooling and commutative skills because this will help guide their mind which would be in a state of change and confusion. When properly informed of necessary information and handson teaching, the adolescent mind will grasp the new information and evolve into a proud and amazing person. They will keep the information close and will use what they have learned and put it into practice when they volunteer or get a job. Teaching with handon activities, like soccer for example, they learn how to communicate quick on their feet, when working on a yearbook with other students, they learn how to come to agreements and solutions on projects. In either activities, they learn how to have fun with lessons they will continue to use even if they do not realize that fact at first. When participating in extracurricular activities children can meet new people and make new friends, who also enjoy activities of similar interests. When participating in extracurricular activities, children of similar interests will be in the same space, and that gives them the opportunity to make new friends and learn how to communicate with others. Extracurricular activities provide the perfect opportunity for students to meet other students of different ages and they learn new things from children who have a better understanding of the changes children go through unlike adults. While most adults try and provide comfort, they can no longer understand the emotional stress, pain, and physical changes the adolescence has to endure, of course they may have gone through it to, but that does not mean they still understand the stress or pain like they used too, because the subconscious of the human mind nine out of ten of the time puts their bad memories, pain, and discomfort into the deepest part of the mind to be forgotten like dust in the wind. So adults understanding adolescences mental panic is out of question. While adults can not understand, extracurricular activities provide the perfect place to find other students who understand and will provide comfort a student may ever need. Extracurricular activities also promotes self confidence and may raise the adolescences selfesteem to an exhilarating high, which then in turn gives the adolescence a more prideful, self confidence. Extracurricular activities are the breading ground of opportunities and fun. When an extracurricular activity is given a chance by a student, the will learn and enjoy all sorts of things. Children will learn extraordinary life lessons in the most spectacular way, the learn that confidence comes from within, they may also learn making a friend is their choice and not their peers or families. They can even find a friend that will be forever at their side, to always have their back and beyond. Having students of all ages participate in extracurricular activities will in the end be the best thing to learn from. These activities may even give a glimpse of what they should expect and prepare for in the future. Extracurricular activities will surely help children excel into the unknown, and it will help them see that the best of things will only take them a little push.\n",

      "Error processing text: Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren't interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more mobile to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communites where carfree zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more cropped up due to rushhour restrictions essentially boosting the economy. The lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter. Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you'll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lungrelated health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air. Source 2 Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. Carfree day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis. Source 3 Finally, New York City has implemented a new bikesharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a costeffective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price. Source 4 These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stressfree lifestyle. Stress and rushhour are known to have some corollation, but newer communites are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communites that has started to smart plan. Over 70 percent of Vauban's occupants don't own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there. Source 1 A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always tense. But now, she's a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the chattering of wandering children. Source 1 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA is suggesting that we start implementing these car reduced communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stressfree environment for these new communites' residents. Source 1 Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution. Source 3 Not only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communites are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Carfree day, that both parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rushhour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish. Source 3 Cars are starting to become a thing of the past, according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children 19 and 21 don't have licenses. They say they're interested, but it's not a priority for them, she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them. In conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these carfree communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community's economy, but also the entire nation's economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing.\n",

      "Error processing text: For most people it is more common to get from place to place by hopping in a car. But, what if we never used cars, or at least limited them? Lives would be inpacted in a very positive way. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paris bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata , by Andrew Selsky, and The End of Car Culture , by Elisabeth Rosenthal the authors show how cars are not a neccesity to life and how our communities can even be better off without them. Because of the positive impact on our enviroment and the increase of a community, limiting car usage is a serious idea worty of a second look. Cars, especially in America, are a major source of transportation. Without them many people would not have an easy way to commute to where they need to be. But, convience is causing more pain than pleasure and startign to harm our enviroment. Cars just by themselves cause around fifty percent of the greenhouse gases that are emited into the atmospere. Similarly they cause twelve percent in Europe par. 5 Logically it would make sense to find the root of a problem and change it to make the problem go away, but in the case of cars, cars are a root in the pollution problem, but many people need them to ge to get where they need to be. The easiest solution to this is to limit our car use and add more busses and easier, more acessable areas for bikes and walking. Pollution will lower and people will still get to where they need to be. Pollution is a major topic regarding the safety of our enviroment and cars have been a proven source of much of the pollution in the air. Using less cars coensides with less pollution in our surroundings. Paris, France was suffering from very high pollution in the air. To combat this, for five days certain people, based on their lisecense plate number, were not allowed to use their cars. Though not everyone complied, after the five days the smog went from the levels found in the worst city for pollution, Beijing China, down by sixty percent par.14. In just under a week Paris went from being the most polluted it had ever been to a better, safer level. If a city just by limiting the car usage by half was able to make such a drastic difference in that time, imagine it being limited more over a wider area. There is a possibility of totally correcting the pollution problem worldwide, or at least making it better and more easily handled. Although the enviroment is important, cars are also affecting the way we interact as people in a community. Because we have cars, we never really see the senery around us. We exit our houses, jump in our cars, drive, and walk ito our destination. There is no contact with nature or other people passing by. Limiting cars can lead to the increase of interaction and better looking cities. In Bogota, there is a day once a year called carfree day, in which no one is allowed any use of their personal cars and fined if they do not comply. Because of this there has been an increase in new highend resturants and places to shop. The community has also added more city parks and places for sports. There is no traffic rush hour and due to the increased walking the old broken sidewalks have been replaced with larger new ones par.28. No one wants to not only have to walk, but have to walk on a surface that is hard to walk on and unappealing. Due to this, people started to create parks and sports centers for a nice place to be as well as a nice place to look at. And because of the increased foot traffic, there have been more people opening shops and resturants, as no one speeding by in a car will notice a small corner store, but someone strolling by, taking in the scenery will. In response to the increased foot traffic, it is important that there is somewhere to actually put your foot, and old cracked pavement won't cut it. If there are less cars, less road pavement is needed and more sidewalk pavement is. So, the old pavement is replaced with more pavement that is in better shape. All the walking and passing people causes people to be more social and to interact more often. The members of a community are more together. Mr. Sivak, a researcher, had noticed both of his children are not interested in getting a driver's licence. Everything they do is centered around walking, public transport, and carpooling. They don't find it necissary to have a car and licence par. 39. The children of the researcher don't have or need a car because what they do doesn't require them to have one. They get a more full experience not being in a car all the time. In a carpool they get to socialize with friends and while walking they get an outdoor and community experience. In short, cars are an easy way to get from area to area, but they are very harful to the enviroment and our community. They add pollution to the air and cut off our everyday contact. If we limited the use of cars we would lower pollution, casuse our cities to be more attractive, have better ways of transport, and be closer as people in an area. So, is a car still going to be your most common way of transport? Think of the good you would do to the world if it wasn't.\n",

      "Error processing text: As the word 'summer' enters you mind, the thought of a beaming sun, turbulent waves, and tropical islands may subconsciously enter your mind. Summer time is the longest break given to students within the United States education system, this evokes the fear that with all this time spent out of school, students will begin loosing their ability to learn. Some schools are deciding to tackle this issue by administering summer projects during break to assure that students continue their education. With that being said, the question of who gets to design these projects must be asked. Should teachers be given another responsibility on their shoulders? Or should students be given the freedom to create their own educational project? To ensure that students receive both a resting period from the rigor of school while maintaining their educational abilities, they should be given the ability to design their own summer project. By allowing students to do so, projects can be tailored to meet individual academic rigor, be altered to fit personal goals of the students, and provides a more fun and engaging activity which will motivate them to learn. It is no surprise that each student in the educational system has their own set of challenges and intellectual abilities. Forcing the same content to each student completely neglects this fact. Some students may feel extremely challenged while others may feel as if they are not being challenged enough. To combat this issue, students should be provided the ability to choose the rigor of their own summer project. As a result, each student will be challenged just enough, to the point where are are 'on their toes' academically, but do not feel consumed by the content of the work itself. Many of the world's accomplished scientists felt suffocated in the curriculum mandated environment of school, and were only able to thrive when afforded the opportunity to curate their own work. For example, Albert Einstein. Einstein himself struggled in school and eventually lead to him leaving the education system. His greatest findings, however, came when he was given the ability to create his own project. By doing so, Einstein could find things that challenged him, even though it was different from what the school system had implemented. Some people may argue that allowing students to set the bar on their own academic rigor will allow them a scapegoat to choose easy topics. Education is a self discovered path that must be navigated by the student. Apart from the fact that teachers already have so much on their plate, and adding project planning on top will place more stress on them, a student has the right to challenge themselves as needed. This does not mean that a student is alone in this path. Teachers should be given the ability to approve andor disapprove of project ideas. Therefore, both parties can find a happy medium. The intensity of the project being custom tailored to the student will allow them to better comprehend the information in a way that is not driving a hatred towards education With that being said, studentdesigned projects also give children the opportunity to focus their content around personal goals and interests. The project itself can be used as an exploration tool for student in what they hope to be their future career, or a subject they show high levels of interest in. For example, a student interested in medicine has the opportunity to learn about medicine this way she has more context when deciding what she would like to do in the future. If teachers were to design their projects, it would be impossible to ensure that the interests of every single student is met, hence, allowing students to decide what they choose to learn about warrants the ability for them to learn what they love. This information they gain could deem to be vital when they decide minor things such as what classes to take the following year, all the way to larger aspects such as what careers they would enjoy. Many of the top chief executive officers in technology companies struggled with this situation. Their schools did to provide them the ability to explore different topics and careers, hence they left and decided to tackle it themselves. People like Bill Gates on the other hand were given opportunities in school to explore computers and software, he credits all his success to these very opportunities given to him. This demonstrates the importance of sanctioning the ability for students to learn about their focuses, this way they will not only learn, but understand their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, by allowing students to design their own project, the learning aspect becomes more exciting and engaging. Motivation is essential when trying to get students to learn and cooperate. This characteristic can be hard to cultivate when students are forced to learn subjects that do not excite them. If given the opportunity to choose their own projects, students will pick something that intrigues them. This curiosity will make it easier for them to want to learn and eventually continue learning. Many successful people end up doing well in fields that are similar to their favorite subject in school. This shows the probable direct relationship between enjoyment in subjects and eventual work ethic when it comes to these subjects. Some may argue that this will prompt students to choose a childish project, however it is important to remember that there are still guidelines placed on the project. Teachers should still be granted the ability to view proposed project topics and either accept or reject them. Nonetheless, enjoyable projects will motivate students to actively learn. Summer should no longer represent a time where students loose previously gain knowledge. Education is an extremely important aspect of student's lives and to ensure that they foster their love and passion for learning, students should be given the opportunity to design their personal summer projects.\n",

      "Error processing text: Students nowadays are being more drawn to technology more than ever before. This even brought the attention of many schools to allow distance learning for students. Many students would benefit from video conferencing or online classes by allowing students who may have social anxiety or have experience bullying to take an online class, students can also learn more effectively at the comfort of their own home, and can even save time and energy for teachers and students alike Nowadays, many students suffer from some form of mental illness. In fact, 1 in 4 high school and middle school students suffer from some form of depression or anxiety. In order to combat this raging epidemic, online or video conferencing must be provided. Although some may say allowing online classes can take away from the high school experience, that however, is flawed because many people have benefited from online classes not only in grades, but in mental health. For example, my friend Generic_Name suffers from anxiety caused by recent school shootings and social interaction. She constantly over thinks every social interaction and even thinks the person she is talking to is ridiculing them when in reality, that is not the case. She eventually did take an online class at the comfort of her own home, which reduced a lot of the stress she had from school. I saw a gradual increase in her mood. If someone like her can improve, many others can as well. She was no longer afraid of her previous fears. Another example is with myself. When I was injured during a wrestling tournament, I was gone away from school to recover. I, however, wanted to continue my education so I would not be far behind when I came back. I picked up a video conference call with my teachers and was able to catch up with my classmates. I was relieved and was stress free when I came back. Schools should not only allow it, but they should motivate their students in taking online classes as an viable option. With schools becoming ever more competitive, this has put a tremendous amount of weight on not only students, but teachers as well. By allowing distance learning, much of this unneeded stress can be lifted form their shoulders. With online classes comes the ability to record a class in session, compared to not being able to record a lecture from your teacher. Although some may say students may cheat or slack off during online classes, online classes already have built in counter measures to mitigate those exact problems. For instance, I took an online class during the summer for Algebra 2. My class and I had to be all online at a certain time throughout the week. The class only lasted for an hour and thirty minutes, with small quizzes and lecture notes. I was able to ask questions and talk to my online teacher more effectively than I would have in a class in school. I came out of it with a B overall, and definitely learned more because of the online class. Not only that, but my teacher who was also taking care of her kids, was able to be a mother and teacher at the same time. If there was anything wrong on her end of the call, she would quickly excuse her self and give us a small break time until she resolved any issue. It was flexible and effective. Schools must encourage individuals to take online classes if they want to see improvement in their students. I think everyone has been there. The point where you decide to go into Lala land for a quick minute, only to become lost in the lecture the teacher has been giving, scrambling to find out what just happened. In online classes, teachers and students can record a lesson in any given moment. It is way more convenient for the teacher and student to record a lecture, than to restate everything that has been said. Not only that, but students can re watch, or re listen to any part of the class to get a better understanding of the subject. While some may say online classes encourages shortcuts to be made, this however is flawed due to the fact that many students prefer, and many more students end up passing online classes more than a conventional class. For example, my friend and I had to make up an assignment over Spring break. We had the option to take an online video conference call with my English teacher to be retaught the subject. My friend and I came in not wanting to do it. Since it was Spring break and I would rather play video games all day and stay outside past curfew with my friends. However, the video conference call changed the way I viewed my class and my own teacher. I was able to communicate, and even joke around my teacher making her laugh. It allowed for what I thought to be something serious, to be something fun and enjoyable. After Spring break, my friend and I became even more close, and still visit my sophomore English teacher to this day. In an age where technology is growing ever more prevalent with the old and young. The school system is systematically failing its students by creating a stigma with online classes and video conferences. There is a lot to be benefited for the youth, especially now with these options in learning. It not only solves many of the problems society faces today, but it can also bridge the gap between students and teachers. Teachers are getting out of touch with their students, but by allowing online classes, more often than not, students and teachers will grow to understand one another in a comfortable environment. Classes should not be looked at with disdain from both parties, but should be looked at with optimism and positively. In an already serious world, society should bring back the fun in learning.\n",

      "Error processing text: The culture of the car has been coming to an end. With many people now choosing to have other forms of transportation. Now in Germany they are making cities where they help banned car usage. In the romantic city of Paris,France they are now starting to banned cars due to the overload of smog. The city of Bogota,colombia is having a special day where they banned cars and see the effect of now having cars for a day. The car usage is now being observed to do damage around the world and due to that now cities all over the world is now banning the car usage. This will help to have a healthier earth and healthier people. The benefits of banning cars is going to help everyone and even our beloved earth. In Germany the people have made a city where they have given up their cars. The city I believe has a better way to maintain a healthy and cleaner environment than other cities in Germany. The banning of cars has been a great success with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is permitted,the problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car intensive areas in the United States.The greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars. Now that we are able to stop it lets take that chance to help stop the greenhouse gas and to make cleaner and healthier cities. The romantic city of paris is having a bit of a problem its that its beautiful city is now being coveres in smog due to the overuse of cars. now that Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to help clear the air they can't help to notice that when there are fewer cars being operated the smog begins to clear up. The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found. The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe. That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog. If the the cars are able to to be banned in paris we will see a drop in the smog and Paris will return to the romantic city that it is. The city of Bogota,Colombia has been celebrating the day without cars for over three years straight. The car free day help leave the streets of the capital city without any traffic jams. One problem of the road that many countries have in their capital city is that they have to many cars because of the tourist and the huge number of people who live there which causes traffic jams leaving cars in the streets for hours on end. They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog. The replacing of cars for bikes and walking is not so much a bad idea if it will help benefit evryone around you. In conclusion, the car culture is now coming to its end. That nations all over the world has seen the great benefits from banning cars. The greatest effects that banning cars has is that they are helping to get rid of air pollution,stress,and the grreenhouse gas. These are all benfits for everyone it helps the ither people beside u and the environment. The romantic city of Paris was covered in smog due to cars. In Germany where they have developed a city where there is no car in sight and has everything within a walking or bike distance. The city of Bogota,Colombia making a holiday that has been going on for three years straight to have no cars for a day. The people have been seeing that the effects of having no car is wonderful and that we should all do it to better ourselves and to better out enivornment.\n",

      "Error processing text: Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. Therefore, a revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world using personal automobiles less. The new aspect of using cars less has promoted a happier society, a cleaner environment, and an open attitude towards alternative transportation. First of all, by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stressfree. The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this carfree community when she states, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal. By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual carfree day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the carfree day is a good opportunity to take away stress... Selsky. As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude. With a smaller amount of people using their personal vehicles, less gas emissions are becoming a part of the Earth's atmosphere. Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are responsible for 12 percent Rosenthal. This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions Chicago Tribune. To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth. Last, declining the use of cars creates an open attitude towards alternative transportation methods. Those who live in carfree communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will carpool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to get where they needed to be Selsky. Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends Rosenthal. Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world. In conclusion, a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stressfree society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices. The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote. Source B also in paragraph 12 says, Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million. That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70. That is a tremendous difference in population. Don't let our country plummit into bad election. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote. With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right. Source C says, At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the swing states. Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000. Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads. Just as Source D states, The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people. What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress? It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if it happened again? Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush? Thank that to the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. But why? First of all, Source E states, So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does. But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair. The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do. This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play. It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California. Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, They are the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Once again, this statement is unfair. This is favoritism. This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more thoughtful. Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote. People want to make their own decisions. It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important. With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote. So it's official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason. It's fair. There's only one thing I have to say to you. State Senator, please abolish the electoral college. Sincerely, PROPER_NAME\n",

      "Error processing text: Knowledge is power. This phrase holds true even till today, and will most likely hold true for all of eternity. The more knowledgeable a particular person is, the more power they posses. Now it is no mystery that the public school education system has and is failing many of this country's youth, but what is a mystery is how to solve this conundrum and fix America's public education system. One of society's most powerful tools is the internet, so why not use it to help educate our youth? Some teachers have seen this resource and decided to take advantage of it and help educate their class with various online videos and websites. But why not take it one step further, and use this marvelous resource to our advantage and help teach students online? Some schools have taken the initiative to do precisely that, and now offer classes online for students to take, also known as distance learning. Distance learning benefits students by allowing them more flexibility and versatility to learn, adds more positive options for learning, and removes certain restrictions and concerns that come from having to attend a physical location for an education. Life is extremely unpredictable. Anything can happen that might withhold a student from being able to attend school, ranging from a fatal car crash or something as simple as pressing the snooze button a few too many times. Sometimes life dictates that going to school isn't going to happen. By allowing students to move the classroom from their classroom to their house, they are able to have more flexibility and versatility in their lives and receive the proper education they require. Online classes makes getting an education easier for students. Why wouldn't that be a positive? If classes start at 730, students may have to wake up as early as 500 in order to get themselves prepared for the day. If a student doesn't take the bus, online classes free up the students parents, and allows them to have one less responsibility in their, possibly, extremely busy day. It also saves them money, whether it be for gas or for a taxi. It frees up the student, by giving them the opportunity to not have to get dressed. It may take 30 minutes or even an hour for a student to shower and get dressed, but by removing this routine, that is an extra hour that the student is able to sleep. Many argue that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but by requiring students to attend a class somewhere else, many students sacrifice eating, in order to arrive to class on time, yet online classes can help students enjoy the benefits of breakfast. Online classes make students lives more flexible and versatile by allowing them to decide when to take the class. One could argue, that the internet is the greatest resource available. Unlike a book, information on the internet can be updated and corrected, without having to print and buy an entirely new book. The internet is also free, and provides various explanations that can cater to various different people and their learning styles. But many teachers restrict their class, by not taking advantage of this marvelous resource. While in class students must learn by any means the teacher uses, and if the teacher fails to explain a certain topic, the student suffers. In class, students can not search up a subject on the internet, it would most likely be a disaster if they could. Many students don't even ask questions, because they are afraid of humiliation, and if they do, they do not continue to inquire if they are still confused because they don't want to frustrate their teacher or look unintelligent. With the internet, this doesn't occur. Users are able to ask the dumbest questions imaginable, free of judgment. It also allows them to be more thorough, thus allowing them to better understand the subject and content better. All of this is possible with online classes, because students can rely on the internet to get accurate information, explained to them in a multitude of ways. If they don't like one websites explanation, they can look at another. The internet provides a variety of different websites to learn from, thus, allowing more options for students. Some could argue that a person could teach better than a book or website, and while this is true to an extent, online school doesn't remove the teacher, it only allows for another option, which is always a positive. If students still want to go to class, they still can. Having brick and mortar institutions comes with its restrictions. Whether it be a bank or a school, having institutions online makes life easier. Classes are held at a certain time period, and while this may be a plus for some, this definitely comes with restrictions. If a student doesn't arrive on time or misses the day, there is nothing more that they can do. With online classes, students are able to still learn and possibly learn even better than in class. Another issue many schools face is harassment, and online classes can help with this as well. Even though it is important for students to learn how to act and react in social settings, if a student is being harassed by a group of students, they now have the option to be able to avoid them altogether. A classroom is restricted by the teaching style of a teacher. If students aren't compatible with a teachers teaching style, they have to figure out a way to solve their problem on their own. Online classes remove the middle man, and allow students to learn on their own. Education is vital and key to the success of any nation. If humanity hopes to survive, it must be able to adapt and learn to evolve the systems already in place to try and improve society, such as the education system. By using one of humanities greatest accomplishments, the internet, schools can vastly improve, in turn, improving society as a whole. Distance learning is beneficial because of the flexibility it allows, the opportunities it offers, and the restrictions it disables.\n",

      "Error processing text: Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is what is better for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord. A student who designs their own summer project will have a engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a students to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention. Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go though the steps of conception, planningdesign, makingprototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficient and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that puts them under control of a project. The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also put them in charge of learning. Being able to self pace yourself, will help to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning. A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is effectively gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically. To wrap up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehendinglearning at their own pace. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to help keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to help them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used.\n",

      "Error processing text: When it comes to talking about choosing between a project over summer break, should it be where the student can choose their own design, or where the project is designed by the teacher. I think that if a school has a summer project it should be studentdesigned, so that the student will want to do the project over summer. When a student does something one does not like one does not usually remember doing the project when one needs to present in class. If a student can have a choice of any subject to do a project as long as school appriorate over summer the one can enjoy and choose also will make students more energetic to complete the project on time. Students should be able to design their own projects because the students will be able to express their feelings, emotions, and inner thoughts. When students usually start working a design made by them they start with how the feel in the moment and how they have felt in the past. The first thing that starts to show when a student is working on a design made by them is one's feelings towards the subject that the student's is working on. When someone expresses their feelings in this way one puts a lot of effort into the project and will make the project really show and really speak. Mainly because it is a reflection of how the student's feelings are shown on the subject for the project. Also when a student tends to show one's feelings it tends to make the student work and be more positive and happy. The reason being the student is able to do something they like and not being forced to do something they do not like. When students are working on a design that is their choice and the student is working with one's feeling on a subject the students true emotions start to show. When it comes to the second thing, the student starts to add their emotion about the subject deep down and how their emotions are truly. When a student shows their emotions one wants to be heard in a positive way if the student has a choice to design a project on a subject student's choice the student tends to be happier and is will to work on the project. Meaning the student is not upset when they are forced to do a project over break because they get to choose and show their own emotions on the subject that the student chooses. When it comes to choosing between a teacher most likely making the project based on book work, or the student enjoying summer doing a project that the student designed. Also the student would be able to work with either a friend, or a family member. When a student starts to show one's feelings and emotions towards a subject of the students choice, the student tends to start to show their true thoughts towards the subject by choice. The third thing that shows the most when a student designs their own project over summer it will show their true inner thought on the project that the student is designing. When a student starts to show their true inner thought on a project one tends to be more vocal on the subject the designed because it is how they really feel deep down. Meaning when one starts to talk about their own thought they talk in a more positive direction and try to be more friendly because the student wants someone to listen. Also when students are talking about their opinion the students get a chance to express how they feel inside. Mainly because in today world students do not have a say on how the schools are run and the students should be able to choose their own design. When talking about studentdesigned projects and teacherdesigned projects people needs to talk about both sides, teacherdesigned projects can be fun and helpful to learn from also to teach with. When talking about teacherdesigned projects, people need to also realize some students are not capable enough to create their own design and needs a teacherdesigned project instead of a studentdesigned project. When talking about projects designed by teachers for over summer some of the projects are fun and exciting, but some are just book work and studying. Mainly because the students should be entertained by what they are learning and being able to learn something from the project. When mentioned a minute ago, teacherdesigned projects can be helpful in the meaning of learning how to grow plants, or learning the chemical reaction in putting mentos and cocacola. The reason being some students when they grow up want to be a gardener and some want to be scientists. The main thing is that students should be able to choose their own design for their projects during break because it is the students own time and they should be able to express their own feelings towards subjects they like. When it comes to talking about teacherdesigned projects and studentdesigned projects, people have to remember that everyone should have a choice on the work they have to do during their own break. When a student makes a choice on what they have to do over break is based of how they feelings about the topic at the time. Also when a student works on their own design they tend to start putting more emotion into the design because they chose what they wanted to do. Mainly, but most of all, when a student works on a subject the students share their inner thoughts with the world. Students should be able and be capable to design their own projects and choose the subject so they can express how they really feel deep down about the subjects so they can talk about how they feel. When wondering which side to take both are good but there has to be a choice either teacherdesigned projects over summer break, or studentdesigned projects over break.\n",

      "Error processing text: Going place to place in a car is surely the fastest way possible, compared to taking a crowded bus or train. Having your own car is very wonderful, you get to have the space to yourself no noisy people around you, you can turn the music all the way up if you wanted to. Yes, all that's great for you but, have you thought about the consequences? Well, not consequences per say but there are bad side effects to having a car. The biggest reason being is that heavy car usage can pollute the air and harm the environment as well as yourself. Some people think that cars aren't the biggest reason as to why the air is polluted, and use that as an excuse to keep driving. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. quoted from source 2. The smog that was mentioned was from the over usage of cars in Pairs, smog that heavy could be toxic and very bad for your health. Heavy car usage does pay a strong role in the pollution that we have. Since most people who have a car use it all the time, I could just imagine how bad the air is right now. Due to the high smog levels in Paris they had to put a ban on using cars, and if someone were to use their cars they would be charged a 22euro fine which is 31 USD. This ban was later lifted to oddnumbered plates when the smog cleared enough. Pairs wasn't the only one to ban cars. As quoted from source 1 VAUBAN, GermanyResidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before they have given up their cars. In Vauban, Germany they have completly taken away cars! Unlike some people who can't live without their car for more than 2 days, A whole community has been without one for much longer. when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, quoted from source 1. Without a car they have nothing to worry about and in term live much happier lives, they also save up money since they don't have to pay for gas, doesn't that sound good? Now, you don't have to go to the extremes of giving up your car completly but limiting the amount of times you use your car would be a fantastic start and if everyone around the world limits the amount of time they use their car by half, even by a quarter, the air around us would be much more clean and happy. Alternatives other than using your car can be going on a train or bus, and yes I know I said that they can be a little unappealing, but I rather suffer a couple of minutes on a bus or train than having the long term effects of a polluted environment. Don't like the idea of going on public transportation? How about car pooling? If your friend wants you to drop them off somewhere that's on your way to work anyhow, give it to them, beats having them drive their car and get more pollution in the air. As stated in Source 4 I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don't really car. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn't work. BART is reffering to the Bay Area Rapid Transit. As you can see, even young people would rather take public transportation if available. Cutting down car usage can also mean you get to go out for more walks than usual! Walking is very important for your health but also for the environment, since of course, walking doesn't cause pollution. As stated in source 3 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. This all happend in Bogota, Colombia ever since their Day Without Cars started, their community and outdoor lives have improved dramatically. Walking can give you a chance to get some fresh air and cool your minds off things you might be dealing with. If you don't want to walk alone, walk with a friend and get to know each other better, don't just sit in a car talking on the phone with them, cars have made people less interactive. Invite your friends to go out walking with you, to a park, to the mall maybe catch a movie, or something else along those lines. Not only walking, but biking or skatebording can be a fun alternative, distract your mind with other activities or find a fun and enjoyable way for you to get you fom one place to the next, without the use of a car! But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. quoted from source 4. This is an amazing start for us in the US, we are slowly growing away from cars, or well, we seem to be a little less interested in them than we were years ago! We still have a long way to go, but, I strongly believe that going without cars or using cars less is a real benefit to our society, and to us as individuals.\n",

There is a lot of people doing a lot of activities everyday and some others doing nothing than just watch TV. Each human person in the world have a purpose , goal to get in a future and is something that we really want to have in our life. Unluckily purposes don't come by itself as a miracle. Every person has a different purpose,some purposes are complicated to reach,and there's also some less complicated but doesn't make any difference because every person decides and picks what are their purposes and whether if they give up or they do anything to reach them. Thomas Jefferson wrote Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. Some person's give up easily, they think is impossible, hard, complicated, but basically what they are doing is waste their capacity to make something and improve themselves, just because someone doesn't trust in our capacity means we have to stop doing what we like and quit . It won't be perfect at the first try , it may not be the same thing that we were expecting, but the effort you put is what it counts. Quit is the easy way to give up , and that is they way to demonstrate weakness the people that didn't trust in us would laugh and spread the rumors of our fail. We won't feel good after that and we'll feel embarrass of ourselves , we wouldn't be capable of going out with our mind thinking in what other people is thinking . If we fall down we need to stand up again , dropping some tears and being in bed all day won't help , think in what other people might think about us won't do anything than just make us feel even more weak. What we can really do is confront the reality , understand our mistakes try to solve them ,try to get better by the time . No one is perfect we might see people getting their purposes easily and we can't understand how , what we don't know is the reality of how the live by the way we don't need to be comparing our live with others life . A girl from school had extra weight and she didn't played any sports , she was lazy to walk and all her friends were skinny and she felt bad about herself and very ashamed of her body she tried to lose weight but slowly she was quitting ,she was crying a lot and feeling weird and unwanted by everyone , some students started to judge her and no one wanted be her friend and they were bullying her . A lot of girls bother her, and others saw her crying and hurt and they didn't stop them.

Her bones and body develop she got skinnier and after she got back to school everyone got impressed .Now she was more confident and it wasn't easy , it took time , tears , sacrifices but she did it . This is a experience that taught me to see different the things , to see how we can do it , if we want , if we put a lot of effort and we are patient to see the changes. After everything we'll feel great and proud of what we've done. It is hard to try without being scared , without doubt .Believe in our capacities is something that we stopped doing , and say I can't became more common and we hear that everyday. We don't do things we want to do because of our insecurities and our laziness when there is a lot of people dying to have an opportunity. Always is better to try than just watch .Everyone has their daily things to do , some people work , others study , others do both or more things and they don't have time for them. It is necessary to take our time to make this things possible, it is necessary to have clearly our mind and see what are we capable to do and how far we can go .

      "Error processing text: When you need the education, but is not able to accessed from where your are, you have to resort to the next best thing, online schools. The statement made asking if it's beneficial to do online school learning at home or not, my opinion is that it is beneficial for the students to take online classes at their homes. Reasons being that for the students that may have some problems with convenience, online schooling would near completely erase that. There is the convenience of being able to learn online from almost anywhere, students being able to do the learning at their own time, and for students to have a higher chance of wanting to learn since they have the choice of when they want to learn and where they would work best in. The first evidence is that there is the convenience of being able to learn from almost every location around the world where there is wifi or some form of data connectivity. If the student is in a location where he or she is not able to get to the school physically let it because of environmental reasons or health reasons, the use of the internet can allow them the close the gap between them and the teachers thorough a simple video face cam process. With the added benefit of being able to do it anywhere it can also attribute to their comfort, since if they are in a area where they are most comfortable learning in such as their homes, which by its self can help them learn better in a place where the student, attending the online class, is most familiar with. There is also the convenience of time, since if time is not on the students side and they miss a online class day they can simply get a recording of the session allowing he or she to catch up on the topic. There is also the near face to face conversations with the teacher through video face cam, since if it was a private lesson the student and the teacher can get a one on one in two different locations of the world. There are also many free online schools willing to teach for free, so if the student is not able to afford it there are still free online classes for them to take that may very well be not so different from the other online classes where you have to pay. The second evidence of the benefits of online learning is that the student can learn at their own pace. School these days, in the modern twenty first century, can make you get up early and make you sleep very late cause of the given work loads and the amount of topics needed to be studied, leading to sleep deprivation, and it can really impact the performance you have at school which can risk your grades. Thats why the benefits of being able to do the learning at the students convenience is so important. Since the student can wake up at their earliest convenience to get rid of any added fatigued or tiredness so that the student can have the maximum efficiency to learn the topic at hand. This leads the students to have the added benefit of working better just because of getting more sleep. With the increase amount of sleep this gives the added benefit of the student willing to learn, since they are energized and ready to learn they don't have to feel that they are being forced to learn at their worst conditions, especially in a classroom setting where they may also be unnecessary tension or pressure towards the student to meet their teachers expectation there and now. The third evidence is from my own experience, I myself have never done any online classes but I know many friends and family members who do take the online classes and most if not all have given me positive reviews of the online classes they have taken. My cousin in South Korea right now for about three to four year have been taking an online class to learn a different language. The language that my cousin wanted to learn was not a language that was being taught at her current school. So she took to the internet and had found a amazing teacher form Europe willing to teach from minimal pricing for a contract of 3 year teaching, which lead to my cousin having a good deal. Through the online lessons my cousin was able to learn her preferred language and at a low cost, which saved her financially since my cousin was a bit tight on money, and allowed her to learn at home the environment of where she feels the most comfortable at, since is South Korea comfort is a necessity in a academically competitive country. It is not just my cousin numerous friends of mine, who took online classes, have told me that taking a online class at their homes increases the sleep and convenience while decreasing the work load for them at the same time, also allowing them to go over the given notes or materials constantly instead of having to continue on without knowing the material, which makes them want to do the class more, also the online classes have allowed my friends to come to a near face to face experience with the teacher of the online class they were taking. With that being said, through the many added benefits of taking online classes at home. It allows the student to have the convenience of being able to take the class anywhere with wifi or data connectivity and getting the maximum amount of comfort in their own homes, allowing the students taking the online class to do the work at their own time to ensure that the student is ready to learn at their best shape possible during the day, and the evidence of my family member and friends enjoying the convenience of the online classclasses they are taking at home making them want to do the online class even more. So are online classes taken at home beneficial or not, with the evidence and reasoning given I think it is safe to say that it is beneficial.\n",

      "Error processing text: If the principal ever decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity, I would strongly disagree with that idea. After the bell rings at the end of the day, students should have the freedom to do what they wish with their extra time. I am sure that if this happens, most students would not be happy with that, including myself. It is good to have extracurricular activities outside of school, but you cannot force it upon someone. It would be a good idea to encourage it, but not to force it. I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings, students should decide what they wish to do after school, and school is already very stressful, piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal. If this rule was ever put into place, it would take away student's freedom to leave school after the final bell rings. This shouldn't even be the principal's rule anyway. If this unfair rule was ever enforced, the county or someone higher up than the principal should make this decision. Most students including myself, just want to go home and talk to their friends. I am an honor roll student, play two competitive sports, and I am also in the National Junior Honors Society, and putting even more activities on my calender would be very stressful. It is not good to just be lazy and sit around all day, but the school cannot decide what to do for you after the bell has already rung. Even if this rule was enforced nationwide, I still dont think this rule would be the slightest bit fair. Making a student stay after school and do an after school club, would actually make a good punishment for a student who has done something wrong, but forcing busy, well behaved students do that would be extremely unfair. Making a student stay after school is the whole idea of after school detention, which is used as a punishment. Students should decide to do what they wish after school. Most days of the week I have baseball, basketball, I go to the gym, and have 3060 minutes of homework. A lot of the time, I have two of those on the same day, sometimes even three! I am not forced to do any of those activities, I choose to do them. If the student was forced to do an extracurricular activity, that would be something their parents would decide, not the principal. All of my friends including myself strongly dislike school, but most of us are on the honor roll and do other activities, not involving the school. Besides, what benefits is the principal going to get out of forcing something upon their students? When I leave school at the end of the day and finish my homework, I want to get as far as I can get from school. Most days after school, I take a few hours of down time to relax, and a few hours of nonschool related activities. I am a very productive, well balanced person, and being forced to put extra activities on top of the ones I already have, would enrage me. School is already stressful, so piling more school related activities on top of school would be extremely stressful. Being overwhelmed with school, whether you are being bullied or you are failing your classes, can lead to depression. Many cases of teen depression have to do with school. I enjoy being productive and participating in activities, but not when it comes to school. Making students do after school activities would be a very shallowminded thing to do, given the fact that most students dislike school. It is good to encourage students to go to extracurricular activities, but not to force them. In high school I intend to be on one of my school's sports teams, but I am making that decision on my own. Besides, maybe you dont enjoy any of the after school activities. I am already forced to come to school for seven hours a day, and adding another hour or two on top of that would be very tiring and stressful. Doing extracurricular activities are great for you, but not when you are being forced. Just thinking about staying after school for an extra hour or two stresses me out. Someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal. If this ever actually became a rule, It would be followed by more than just one school. It would either be countywide, statewide, or nationwide. I am not saying that I agree with this rule but if this was ever passed, the principal wouldnt have the power to force students to do this. The principal does not have the ability to pretty much extend our school day. That would be something decided by higher up people, like the governor, president, or board of education. The principal just enforces the rules, not creates them. This rule would make many students angry. It wouldnt make anyone happy, because the students that want to do after school activitiess, can still do them just as easily. No one gets any benefits from this rule. Making students participate in after school activities would probably encourage students to cut class more often, and maybe just not even show up to school at all. You can be a well rounded person without having to attend after school activities. Again, I think this rule would be unfair because it takes away student's rights to leave after the final bell rings, students should decide what they with to do after school, piling more school related activities on top of school would be very stressful, and someone higher up in the education system should make that decision, not the principal.\n",

      "Error processing text: Can seeking multiple opinions help someone make a better choice? Do you want your advice to help you make the best choice? When people ask for advice, they tend to ask more than one person because they want to make the better choice for themselves. People who want to make the best choice look for credibility, different ideas, and different views, and they do this by asking many different kinds of people from young to old, people from different countries, and more. They want as much opinions as possible so they can narrow it down to one idea that will help them make the best choice. For example, a student might be researching about the Civil War for their history paper. They might ask their history teacher for ideas because their teacher happens to be history major. The student decides to ask their parents about their views and ideas and it just so happens that they are both professors with a PhD in history. The student gathers all the opinions they got and writes the paper and gets an A. The student knew they were going to pass because they asked people who were experts on history, and listened to their different views and ideas. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views. First of all, people seek multiple opinions in order to make a better choice because of credibility. Everybody wants their advice to be credible and not bogus, so they seek out different websites, books, and people. If a person was having an argument and says that Alexander Hamilton was the best Founding Father and wanted to know more about him, they might go watch the musical, Hamilton . That is just one source, so they decide to read a biography about him. The person decides to go on History. com to research more about the Founding Father, and even visits New York City, the place where Hamilton lived most of his life. The person decides that that is enough information and is satisfied with what they have learned. They know all the information is credible because of all the primary and secondary sources they have used and declares that Alexander Hamilton was the best Founding Father. Credibility is really important when it comes to making a decision and can be difficult when there are many different sources to choose from. Therefore, people seek multiple opinions in order to make a better choice because of credibility. Moreover, people seek multiple opinions in order to make a better choice because people have different ideas. People have different ideas when it comes to almost everything, for example, an art project, which song to perform, which restaurant to go to, and more. If an artist wanted to paint a mural, they would ask other artists for their opinions and what type of message they should go for. One artist might suggest to use vibrant colors, while another might suggest dark colors. One artist might suggest to spread the message on a humanitarian crisis, while another might suggest to spread the message on powerful women. The artist painting the mural decides to go for vibrant colors and to spread the message on powerful women to make it stand out and let people be informed. Getting different ideas from other people is useful when it comes to making a choice when ideas are not coming to mind. Therefore, people seek multiple opinions in order to make a better choice because people have different ideas. Overall, people seek multiple opinions in order to make a better choice because people have different views. People have many types of different views when it comes to their favorite subject at school, their favorite genre of music, politics, and more. Politics, for instance, has people raging with which candidate and platform they think is the best, or they attend protests to support women's rights and to spread word about climate change. According to a recent survey, 95 of students at Generic_School think that everyone should be treated equally. Not everyone at Generic_School has the same views when it comes to equality, politics, or any sort of matter, so when a student wants different views on a certain topic, they might ask their peers. Another student might want to know more about a candidate running for president, so they ask people from different parties, goes to the candidate's website, and researches more about their platform. The student decides which candidate is the best after researching hearing about others' views. Hearing different views from people is a good way to make the final choice. Therefore, people seek multiple opinions in order to make a better choice because people have different of views. In conclusion, making a choice is difficult than it already is, and making the best choice does not seem like it is any more luxurious. Some people might be able to decisions at the speed of light without getting any opinions, while others might need some more opinions in order to make their decision. Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it. Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life. Wanting the credibility, different ideas and views from people is just another way of making the best choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorss, the meeting of the electorss where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electorsal votes by Congress, states the article What Is the Electoral College? written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electorss that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electorss vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an electors of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that electors will go back on his word and vote for another candidate. The article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer states, The single best argument against the electorsal college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electorss, and that those electorss could always defy the will of the people. This means that the people never know if their electorss are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer states, In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way. This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College. Aside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, What Is the Electoral College? written by the Office of the Federal Register states, Most states have a winnertakeall' system that awards all electorss to the winning presidential candidate. That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state they don't receive any electorss. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit swing states. Swing states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer says, During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electorss in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electorsal votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electorss, while Maine only has 4. The article, The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid out defenses of the system are wrong states, Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastrous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, The Indefesible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid out defenses are wrong written by Bradford Plumer states, It's officual The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear Senator, The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizensOffice of the Federal register. Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process. In Richard poster's, In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winnertakeall basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state Posner 1. With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the candidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not acknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress The Office of the Federal Register 1. This adds support that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a successful one. In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, What Is The Electoral College, there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the candidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reiterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...Office of the Federal Register 1. In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the candidates. To add for support, Posner says, No region has enough electoral votes to elect a presidentPosner 1. With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the candidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen tp the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the electionPosner 1. Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens. Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now Plumer 1. The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors... Plumerr 1. This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues. In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election Posner 1. The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.\n",

      "Error processing text: Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportations are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner. It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to fortythousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of Vauban's families do not even own cars, and fiftyseven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. Vauban's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in, Paris bans driving due to smog. Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usuage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usuage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths. In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, rollerskates, skateboards longboards, and penny boards, or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usuage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage. Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in, The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twentythree percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety. With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people. In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usuage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.\n",

      "Error processing text: Cars have always been used to get from point A to point B. That is how the people in society know what cars are for. However, there are other alternatives when is comes to going form one destination to another. Citizens should limit their car usage. It helps with the terrible traffic on the street. Also, there will be no more pollution in the air. In addition, citizens can be able to enjoy the world. Everyone has been caught in traffic, whether it is going to work or school or meeting up with someone. Everyone has been in traffic before. People can prevent traffic form happening. There is carpooling, it can help limit traffic on the streets. Just like it states in source three, ...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. There are other ways to avoid and stop traffic. Not everyone needs to take their own personal car to work. They can either car pool or take public transportation to save money because gas isn't cheap these days. In addition, traffic sometimes end up leading to accidents. There are several people who died in a car accident due to someone speeding because he or she doesn't want to wait in the traffic. However, if everyone just finds another alternative way to get to his or her destination, then no one has to die. Just like it explains in proclaims in source four, pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety. This qoute listed some alternatives way to get somewhere. By doing these things it will not only limit the traffic but the resources and the safety of other people. Traffic isn't a fun place to be in, so find another way to get to his or her destination can prevent traffic. Air pollution is everywhere we go. Whether someone travels to Japan, India, or South America. There willbe air pollution there. It might not have same amount of air pollution as other countries but there is still pollution. Why? Because there are people who uses his or her personal car not thinking about what happens to the air that they breathe. However, there is a solution to limit the pollution in the air. Limiting car usage or find another way to get to the certain destination. Mr. siva even claims that A car is just a means of getting from A to B... Cars is just a means of transportation. So are bicycles, trucks, buses, traind. However, all these have one thing in common, they are all going form destination A to destination B. Biking, walking, skating are some way to stop the gas from the vehicles from polluting the air. Actually, by using these methods pollution can be reduced. For example source three states, ...uneven, pitted sidewalks have bee replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic... When people don't use his or her car and decides to find another way to get to their destination it helps reduce the traffic. There are several people who say that they know what the real world is since he or she travels all the time in their car. However, do people really know the sounds of kids laughter when walking down the side walk or a bicycle bell violently ringing at someone to get out of their way? Not a lot of people know this because they are usually used to their vehicles getting them places. People will argue that they have heard all of those before and that they were happier. But Ms. Walter thinkgs other wise, When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. Ms. Walter has been walking on the streets and she hears the swish of bicycles and the talkative children and occastional a distant motor. These help people better appreciate the world that they live in because not everything will last forever. In addition to this, less cars means more people walking which means that several people will end up walking pass a shop and look what is inside. For instance in source three is explains, Parks and sports centers also have bloomed through the city uneven...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. It helps by walking to find new stores or restaurants people never heard of. Several people believe that the only way to get somewhere is by car. That isn't necessarily true. Skating, walking, biking, car pooling or public transportation can help get anyone from point A to B. Yes, it will take longer on foot than by car but it helps the environment, it stops from the air getting all the gasoline form the cars. It is faster than being stuck in traffic. Someone who is biking to school can be five minutes late while soneone who is took their car and got stuck in traffic can be an hour late. Limiting car usage is a way that everyone can explore the world than being stuck in that four or tw door car. Limiting car usage has its downs but it also have its perks.\n",

      "Error processing text: In modern times, the ease with which students can learn new information through the internet has offered new avenues to learning that were previously unheard of. Students are now able to search through a vast library of online databases if they do not have easy access to materials for learning or need extra assistance. This is helpful for a majority of high school students as they are now able to gain knowledge that previously would take hours out of their schedules in order to find, much less learn. Even though this is the case, there is no genuine substitute for a proper education. Students struggle most when they can not ask questions or receive information in a way they can understand. Although it offers ease of access, students would not benefit from taking classes at home because it results in a negative home environment, decreases interaction between one's teachers and peers, and reduces the motivation of students to work efficiently. The most compelling reason as to why a student be able to do their work at home is how much more convenient for them it is. This is a reasonable argument unless one considers the consequences of an education that has a lack of physical substance. This convenience is a matter of how a student is able to handle all of the work that is being pushed upon them. Students no longer are able to have set schedules already in place for them, instead they must create their own schedule and base everything they do off of the classes they are taking from home. The lowered stress of being able to work from the comfort of their own homes is countered by the increased stress of needing to take matters into their own hands while still balancing a life outside of school. In my personal experience in taking geometry over the summer, I found that, while I enjoyed the comforts of being able to relax and work on my own in my own home, it led to the perception of a connection between my home and schoolwork, resulting in an overall negative environment with the constant fear of work looming over me constantly. Going to school offers students the opportunity to interact with peers and teachers that are able to assist one in learning. Working on an online course means that in order for a student to interact with a teacher or classmate, they must email or text them. Doing this is not only difficult and less efficient, but it also greatly hinders the progress that these same interactions would have physically. While taking geometry online, I had no possible way to contact any of my classmates, and the only way I could interact with my teacher was if I emailed or contacted her through text. This resulted in it being impossible for me to receive an answer within the same day, as I tended to work at night, meaning that if my schedule did not line up with the teacher's schedule, I needed to figure out how to do my work without assistance. This also made it more difficult for me to receive assistance while talking to the teacher, as even when she replied, a full conversation that would have lasted one minute or less with a pencil and paper would require an hour for far less of a return. This essentially removes the possibility of a student to be able to take their work at their own pace, as they are hindered as soon as they encounter a single obstacle in their learning. Working in a classroom, however, facilitates strong and meaningful interactions between their peers and their teachers, as a classroom is designed to achieve. Classrooms are an environment that are created in order to allow students to work as comfortably as possible in a healthy space. A home, on the other hand, is an environment that exists as a safe refuge from work and responsibilities. Students show less desire to do schoolwork at home rather than in class, resulting in a lower rate of finished homework in comparison to classwork. Through my years in high school I have found that I have significantly less motivation to do work once I have arrived in the safe space of my own home. While my grades on tests are good and my classwork is done on time, homework is a much greater issue that heavily impacts my grades. Although for most classes homework is only ten percent of the overall grade, that ten percent results in a full one point towards a student's grade point average, and countries such as Finland showcase how not having homework boosts motivation to work and learn in school, and offers more time out of school for studying and recreation, allowing for a healthier school environment. This shows how vastly different working from home and working from school is, as working from home causes far greater stress and far less desire to work than simply going to school. There is no possible way for a student to acquire the same level of education in an online course as they could in a classroom. The ease with which a student is able to work is no consolation for the stress and difficulties they would encounter as they continued learning more difficult material. Although they are able to work at their own pace and have no need to leave their homes, students would also struggle emotionally and physically from the problems with online learning. This trade off is in no way beneficial to the student, as these problems can grow as they continue learning this way with no other students or teachers to accompany and help them when they struggle.\n",

      "Error processing text: Most schools will assign summer assignments that give students a preview of what their upcoming year will be like in certain classes. This also helps teachers because they won't be teaching a new topic to a bunch of students who have no previous knowledge on the subject. Having summer assignments allows students to have a foot in the door for a new class. These projects would be considered, teacherdesigned. An example of a teacherbased assignment would be assigning students to look into a concept they will be learning that year in the class if you are going into Chemistry, you might be assigned to memorize the periodic table over the summer. I believe that summer projects should be studentdesigned in a way that students have the opportunity to refresh themselves on things they've learned in the past or just a few simple problems or equations a day to keep the brain active. Studentdesigned projects would be more beneficial to students for many reasons they won't be as stressed out to learn a new topic by themselves, they will have the opportunity to refine past skills, and it won't ruin their summer break. Most students in high school have a lot of pressure on them to get good grades, be involved, and stay out of trouble. Whether it be parents, friends, or teachers, every high school student feels stress. Summer break allows students to relax, hang out with friends, and give their brains a break. By assigning summer projects that involve learning a completely foreign topic, the stress of school is reignited and takes that break away from the students. Although assigning these types of projects would be beneficial to the teacher, I believe it is wrong to make students feel more stressed than they already are just so the teacher can catch a break. For example, when I was in 7th grade I took PreAlgebra. I remember it was a pretty hard year for me and I was so happy when it was over so I could relax over the summer. On the last day of school my teacher handed my a book titled, Algebra 1, the basics. We had to complete an entire booklet on a math class that we had almost no knowledge about. I spent hours and hours over that summer trying to teach myself Algebra 1 just so my teacher wouldn't have to. This is just more work that causes unneccessry stress in students already busy lives. Assigning studentbased summer assignments would actually be more beneficial to both teachers and students than you'd think. Most classes build on classes that you've had in the past, for example Spanish 2 builds off of the things you learned in Spanish 1. Students are constantly learning new things and gaining new experiences. When you're constantly learning and growing, it can be easy to forget what youve done in the past. Due to this, classes usually begin the year by reteaching things from previous years. For example, if you took Algebra 1 as a freshman and Algebra 2 as a junior, you would need to review some of those concepts you learned in Algebra 1 to be successful in Algebra 2. If this review work is assigned over summer, students will be able to go into Algebra 2 more prepared and it would save the class a lot of time. The time that would normally be spent on review from previous years could be spread out throughout the year and allow the teacher to spend more time on different units. This would allow the students to feel less stressed about learning a topic in a short amount of time. Speaking of short amount of time, the summer is the 2 months a year that students can wake up every morning and not have to worry about pressing due dates, homework, studying for tests, or anything school related. I wish I could say that there shouldn't be summer assignments at all. However, I recognize they're important for success and are beneficial to us as students. Assigning studentbased assignments are short and easy refreshers for students. I would have no problem waking up every day and doing a couple math problems from a concept I previously learned. Once you get going on a topic you once knew, it all comes back to you and the work should be easy. This is much less stressful than trying to teach yourself for a class you have in the upcoming year. This past summer I was given a summer assignment for my AP Lang class. We were tasked with writing 15 papers about different topics that we chose with one topic per paper. Each page had to written in a specific format called, precis. We were never taught about this format of writing so it made completing the summer assignment extremely difficult. After about 20 hours of work I was finished with the project. As a freshman I was given a summer assignment for my English class that simply tasked us with reading a book. Every day I would go outside, lay down, and read 30 pages of the book. It was a completely stress free experience that kept my mind active over the summer. I find that these summer assignments are far more helpful for students and their mental health. Most students will say that summer assignments are useless and aren't beneficial to anyone. I disagree and can argue that anyone who completes the assignment is benefiting from it. By doing nothing over the summer, you are setting yourself up for a rude awakening come August 24. Summer assignments should simply be used to keep our minds in a school mode without us really knowing. There should no serious work or stress involved. That is why I believe that studentbased summer assignments are more beneficial than teacherbase assignments. After all, the teachers are the ones being paid to teach, not the students.\n",

      "Error processing text: Doing classes from home has been an up and coming subject due to the fact that schools are now handing out school issued laptops. Schooling from home can have major benefits such as being able to sleep in more, being able to do work in the comfort of their own home, and having a wider range in classes as you will have an online professor thus creating a wider range of available classes, compared to what you're given at school. Now the draw back that many parents and students have with it is that there will be too many distractions at home for the student to concentrate. While in theory that sounds true that isn't really the case. With the opportunity to take online classes, students would be able to sleep in more, thus leading them to live healthier lives, and not always be so tired. Students wouldn't have to wake up at six o'clock in the morning just to make their bus at seven to get to a school that starts at eight. They would be able to wake up at seven fifty, to get ready for a class at eight, since all the student would have to do is just open his or her computer, log in, then go to the online class to get the information that is being taught. This would allow those sleep deprived students who have after school activities such as sports or a job to nearly get an extra two hours of sleep. This could also be beneficial for the teacher, allowing them the same exact thing, when it comes to waking up later and allowing them to sleep in and get the rest your body needs to be physically healthy. Also, allowing kids to sleep in and get the necessary sleep they need will cause them to be more engaged in the classroom, and excited to learn, whether it is at home or in a school building. While doing online classes, students would also get the opportunity to do work in the comfort of the student's own home. People in general are more comfortable in their own home, so when given the opportunity to work there, they will likely produce a better outcome as they are more relaxed and aren't as stressed unlike students in school. Students would not have to put on certain types of clothing to impress anybody, helping reduce anxiety about what people think about a person's self. This would also help in decreasing bullying in school cause when someone is at home away from their bully its nearly impossible for the student to feel threatened by the bully while at home, and can even cause the child to want to learn again since they aren't worried about one person messing up their day. And having children engaged in learning and constantly wanting to learn is usually a school's number one priority. One great benefit that doesn't get brought up enough when talking about online class is the fact that students will actually have a wider range in available classes to take. When it comes to being online, people basically have all the knowledge in the world at their finger tips. In school students have the knowledge of out dated textbooks and their teachers. With the ability to take online classes, students are now able to basically take any class they so please to take. Also, if a student attends a certain school, but then wants to learn a certain skill outside of it, like IT, they would have to go to another school to learn it, then have to comeback to school, or if none of the schools in the area offer training on the skill the person wants to learn, that is severely limiting that person's full potential. With online classes there is no limit on what you can learn, everything is already on the internet, they will just need to know where to look. Also, once they find the certain skill or class they want to take, they'll be able to go to where they need to be rested and happy, and will also know what they're learning is something they actually want to learn. The one draw back that people have though is that they think learning at home will cause too many distractions so they won't learn. While that sounds like a very legitimate rebuttal to learning at home, that truly isn't. The main one being that, there are already distractions in school, and whether or not the students acknowledge them or leave them alone is completely up to them, the same is true for learning at home. Yes there are distractions, but if the student ignores them like how the should as if they were in school, then there is no problem. And if the student decides to engage on the distractions they more than likely not were doing them in school, and weren't paying attention to begin with. Students have distractions in school no matter what, and saying that learning at home isn't viable because of it isn't a true or fair statement to make. So basically, taking classes at home can be very beneficial to a student. It can help them get the required sleep that they need. Once getting the sleep they need, these students will feel more rested and excited to attend school cause they won't feel tired or groggy anymore. They'll also be able to work from the comfort of their own home, making them feel safer and calmer. And they will also get a wider variety of class selection if taking it online, thus keeping students interested in school.\n",

      "Error processing text: In the 21st century, technology has infiltrated the lives of Americans, entering into commercial, private, and education spheres. With this new spread of technological innovation, people are able to communicate over long distances. This longdistance communication and the invention of the internet allows students complete assignments online, with some even able to be digitally present in the classroom through video conferencing. However, this form of learning is not beneficial to students as it can reduce social skills and interaction, result in communication errors, and cause students to be distracted while learning from their home. One of the main reasons attending classes from home is not a good form of learning is because it causes students to miss out on social interaction. The widespread use of technology can cause people to spend less time talking in person to someone and more time hiding behind a digital persona. With the use of video conferencing and online classes, students would not be able to have facetoface interaction with their fellow students and would inevitably miss out on social skills that students who attend school gain. As much as school is about learning, it also teaches students how to communicate with others, how to become a leader, and how to work in a group. With the elimination of group projects, social interaction in between and during classes, and the absence of leadership opportunities, online school deprives children of their opportunity to grow their social skills. In addition, students will not be prepared for the workplace, as in a job, one has to communicate with employees and talk to their boss or supervisor frequently. With online school, a student does not have the opportunity to communicate directly with a teacher figure, learning how to express concerns, and form bonds with people that are higher up than them. Without this social skill of learning how to communicate properly with adults, a student is not fit to go into the workplace, making online school not a viable option. Due to the fact that students can hide behind a digital persona and not communicate with others due to technology, they would not be able to benefit from attending school from their home. Secondly, with the introduction of online school, there would be miscommunication between the teacher and student, hurting the ability of students to learn. It has been shown through multiple tests and studies that technology hinders the ability of people to show emotions and convey what they are truly feeling, especially through online chatting and text messaging. This can be translated into online learning, as a student might not know what a teacher truly means through an email, causing a them to become confused. In an actual school scenario, a student would be able to talk to the teacher in person and ensure that they interpreted the information correctly. However, in online school from home, a student's ability to do this is taken away, as their teacher could be hundreds of miles away. Some might argue that with the introduction of video conferencing this lack of proper communication would be eliminated. However, with online school that could be streaming across the country, technology is subject to glitches and shutdowns. In addition, video chatting prevents the teacher from truly showing the student how to perform a task, as they are only able to communicate it verbally, rather than physically fixing it for the student. This could be present in the form of science labs. If a student is setting up the lab incorrectly, a teacher video chatting them may be a hard form of communication as the teacher can only describe to the student how to set it up, rather than actually showing them how to solve the issue in person. Therefore, video chatting is subject to miscommunication between students and teachers, not making it and online school a positive option for a student to learn from. Lastly, a student learning from their home can cause them to be distracted, preventing them from focusing on their projects and lessons. A school is designed to create an environment that helps students focus on their classes and learning, with a set schedule, rules on phone usage and breaks, and quiet environments. However, at home it is the complete opposite, as there are multiple distractions. At home, students have distractions such as siblings, video games, and their phones, which could prevent them from giving their full attention to their schoolwork. In addition, without a set structure for online classes, it could cause students to take many unnecessary breaks, resulting in them falling behind their classmates in their classes. Next, some homes have parents working from home, pets, and young children that could create a noisy environment for a student to concentrate in. Without a proper quiet environment, a student would not be able to entirely focus on the courses they are taking. Finally, a student might ignore their school work altogether with at home classes, as with this new freedom a student would be able to meet with peers at any time, causing them to neglect their responsibilities as a student. Due to the distractions that are present at the home, online school that takes place in a student's house would not be a viable option for students to partake in. With the addition of technology into the world, it may seem that learning from home with the use of technology is the best option for learning. However, attending a physical school and using computers as an aid to learning rather than a form of learning itself is the best option to prepare students for a digital world, as it will give them proper skills and tools to succeed along their learning journey. Because students can miss out on social lessons and skills, are subject to miscommunication, and can be severely distracted, students would not benefit from attending classes from home with the use of technology.\n",

      "Error processing text: In recent weeks, news of new, life threatening viruses such as the Corona virus has gone up at a rapid rate, causing a large amount of disarray and discomfort within the educational system between the staff members, the students, and the parents, it seems inevitable that schools will close to keep the students and the staff members as safe as possible. Once they understood the circumstances, parents and students started to have questions how will the students continue getting their education?, what format will it be in?, and how will it be administered? The response that most school counties developed for these questions was long distance learning. Distance learning is a new format of teaching where students stay at their homes while completing assignments but, this method of learning has gotten somewhat controversial. Many teachers argue that distance learning is not effective and that it allows for students to copy, cheat, or flat out be lazy. This is a true judgment, but misled when distance learning is applied to hard working students, it allows for significantly better results more consecutively, making it way more effective than the current system set in place. The reason for its better performance is because of two aspects number one, it allows for students to learn and practice taking initiative, and number two, its allows for students to learn to identify what their individual work process is, learn to adapt to it, and apply it to the real world. The controversial part about distance learning is one of its fundamental aspects the distance. The system of learning that was in actions for decades was based on a word to mouth learning process, where you had to be instructed in multiple different classrooms, on multiple different subjects, by multiple different instructors it's quite tiresome, I must admit, but the degree of work is not the issue. The issue lies within the spoon fed mentality that develops in a work space such as this a work space entirely devoid of any personal initiative. Never mind don't, when adolescents can't take the initiative for things that deeply benefits them, they will inevitably feel as if they are just a hamster running on a wheel, or just another gear in a clock, causing for a lot of procrastination or laziness the stripping of self initiative develops a feeling of diminished importance in ones self leading to less attentiveness and over all less care for the subjects being learned. Quite frankly, the students that perform the best in school are the ones that are taught from an extracurricular source, whether its from their parents or someone else, about the importance of education, allowing that child to decide for themselves that they want to pursue it wholesomely i e. they took initiative to learn. With distance learning, students can be in the comfort of their own homes and decide for themselves when they feel best to engage in a new topic. Regardless of what educational system is in place, whether traditional learning or distance learning, there will be the students that wont study, will copy their friend's homework, and will cheat on test, its unavoidable this is still true for distance learning, and with common sense, the side effects of it can be determined quite easily. When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this Im going to go out and chill with my friends, Im going to sleep in everyday, im going to go out shopping, or flat out Im not going to do any work. The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work. Work is of key importance to success with out working, you can't attain a great majority of success. Evidently though, work comes in many different forms and styles, usually deriving from how that person had grown up and been raised so, a work process that may come as natural to one person, may be foreign to another. Learning what a person's work process consists of is fundamental to attaining consecutively good results distance learning allows for students to be able to distinctly figure out what schedules and work patterns works for them. While still in the traditional educational system, the process of work during that educational period is at the will of the instructor, if the instructor isnt going at a speed you can comfortably retain knowledge, then a lot of information that is being taught will not be remembered when this process is repeated, it can lead to a development of stress or a numerous slew of issues. In conclusion, if distance learning were to be put into action nationwide, the outcome would be very beneficial. Students that take initiative for themselves will become more prosperous and successful then the ones that don't even then, the students that don't take the initiative are given the opportunity to learn how to and apply it to their lives. With the ability to stay at home, students can get the time to learn their work habits, adapt, and improve upon them so they can preform to the best of their ability, regardless of what they are tasked with. And yes, Although there are students who are not compelled to complete school, the amount will be greatly reduced because of the encouraging nature of distance learning, which allows for students to take their own initiative in learning something beneficial to them.\n",

      "Error processing text: The Internet is Building a Stronger Workforce COVID19 is spreading across the world. Now this disease has killed more people than influenza has this year. Epidemiologists for the CDC are recommending that colleges across the country shut down their campuses and revert to online school so that they disperse the student population to lower the chances of the students getting infected. This suggestion has been readily accepted in colleges throughout the country. Soon public schools could follow the colleges' lead. More and more public schools are introducing a plethora of online classes. Many students are now able to do classwork and take assessments online as well as conference with their teachers from the comfort of their home. Students would benefit from online school through more direct, one on one learning with teachers, building each students aptitude with technology for their future participation in the workforce, and allowing students with a variety of ailments to continue their education at home. First of all, with online classes students would be able to interact with their teachers on a more personal level. Currently, if a student needs help with homework or a concept that they are struggling with, most often, they will have to come and see their teacher before or after school. Some students simply do not have that availability to see their teacher or are too embarrassed to ask their teacher during the class session. With classes being taken online, the student could simply email the teacher privately to work out a time to video conference their teacher for help. This simple interaction with teachers would show that students could go to their teachers more easily and would feel more comfortable when asking questions. With this increase of inquiries, scores in the grade book could go up, increasing parental and student satisfaction. Due to the introduction of online education, teacherstudent interaction would become easier and more common. Second of all, Students would be able to become build their technological skills parallel to learning new material. Many employers in this hypertechnological world are looking for employees that will be able to keep up with new technologies as well as help their business grow. While students are at school, they have access to technology, but this access is limited and most often very basic for most people. If schools' education was offered online, many students would rapidly become accommodated with new and more complex programs and applications. Teachers could require logging of time spent studying on spreadsheets, or taking screen shots of research, as well as making projects on threedimensional design software for every student that they have. So many things in the classroom would have to be transferred online, making students who graduate highly valued to any employer looking to hire somebody. Highschool students who become adept at using online applications would be beneficial for a student and future employers. Third of all, any student that has to stay at home or be hospitalized due to a sickness would be able to continue their education. Throughout the year every school has a variety of issues, but one issue can truly devastate an education. If a student that is a tenth grader comes to school with what they think is a minor cold and goes about their entire day, many students would interact with this sophomore and soon all of these students would be home sick. Due to the transmission those classes would only have half the students it should have. This issue is morbidly obvious. However true this issue is, disease cannot spread through technology. Any students taking these online courses would be safe from any other students who are sick. This would allow schools' education to run with a little more grease on their axles. Due to students having an online education many students who become sick would not have to pause their education for any amount of time. In order to address those opposed, it is understandable for anyone to do so, but not forgivable. Many would say that the students would lose their friends, that they might become awkward, and that students might even cheat on assessments. All of these are understandable, but they are not without solution. Schools would be getting rid of their on campus schooling but would still host extracurricular activities and sporting events, along with gym classes, as well as dances and pep rallies. This would help retain student friendships at school. Students cheating on assessments has been a problematic in all school systems for years, writing on your arms and hands, looking at a friend's paper to see which bubbles they filled in, or even feverishly copying someone's homework in the hallways outside of a class. While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well. Students could use their phones to search for answers to a variety of tests or share their answers with friends via text message. Their is no end to the creativity of someone who wants to cheat on an assignment, that is why a student's parent could supervise the student on each test and let the teacher know that the student was honest. This would be an easy way of reassurance for all instructors. In conclusion, online school for students could be greatly beneficial. Through one on one interaction with teachers, spurring more inquiries from pupils, becoming more proficient with technology at school and in the workplace, and allowing students who are afflicted with disease, and sometimes an injury, to attend school. Online school would benefit many students in this modern world. Now do what you think is right, go to a school board meeting, or sign a petition, because once we make this change, the Virginian education system will be stronger than any other state's. Now that isn't able to be said every day.\n",

      "Error processing text: Over the last 10 years, schools have been making kids do a extracurricular activity,Generic_Name, at Generic_School. Our newest controversy started earlier this year about kids must do or dont have to do an extracurricular activity. My principal has made up his mind about how students at our school must take a extracurricular activity. I agree with my principal that students at my school must do an extracurricular activity. One reason why I agree with my principal that we made students do a extracurricular activity is to get involved with your school. Generic_School Chairman found out that over 1,000,000 kids are doing a extracurricular activity at their school right now. That is not enough we need more schools to make an impact on their students to make them do extracurricular activities. Getting involved with your school is a great way to make new friends, and to not be stuck to your video game at home. I actually got involved with the school all my years here at middle school. In 6th grade I was on the basketball team, and in 6th, and 7th I was a ambassador, and now in 8th grade Im an ambassador as well. An ambassador is a student who is just an allaround leader, and doesnt do anything wrong. As an ambassador you make sure everybody is safe, and also make sure nobody is getting bullied. The second reason why I agree with my principal about making the students here at our middle school do a extracurricular activity is what if they actually are good at it, or maybe what if they like it. A teacher at Generic_School found out that most of these kids who actually try something new, then they end up sticking with it, she said it was over 75 of most students. Thats a good amount! I bet that a lot of these kids probably did sports like soccer, basketball, football, or baseball at their schools, or even signed up for the yearbook staff or lastly became a student council. I know that at our school we have a basketball team, and baseball team, Odyssey of the mind, student councils, yearbook staffs, and the list goes on and on. Our principal thinks we need more. I agree with him on that. This is one reason why I agree with my principal on making students at our school do a extracurricular activity. The last reason why I agree with our principal on making kids do an extracurricular activity is that it can help you with your emotions. Generic_Name stated that Most kids or students who end up doing an extracurricular activity is actually relieving off stress and anxiety. I know for a fact that that can help you loose stress. One way that I love to loose stress is by working out and playing basketball, football, and lacrosse. All of these things get my mind off things very easily, and they also make other things going on around me less stressful. Over the last couple of years kids have been on their video games and phones a lot, and its causing a distraction to their mental side of life. Kids are getting more depressed second by second by just playing video games. I know for a fact if they try something out doors, then they wont be as depressed or hopeless. Kids deserve so much more in the world. On the other hand, a lot of schools are not making kids take an extracurricular activity. They think that the students dont have do if they dont want to. I can see where their coming from and they have a good point. You dont have to do something if you dont like it, but it is always good to try something new. Generic_School reported that over 25 of schools dont have their students taking an extracurricular activity. They said that they wanted to focus more on their education instead. I dont take pride in what other people thoughts and beliefs are, but I know for a fact that kids must do a extracurricular activity. It makes more sense, you want your students to be more involved with your school, and you want them to do something that they might actually like. I know that at Generic_School in Texas has yearbook activities, and they found that over half of their school is doing that, because they love it and they want to pursue making designs and other things like that. To sum it up, I agree with my principal about making it so all of our students at my school must do a extracurricular activity. The reasons why I agree with him are one getting involved with your school, it is always good to help your school out and to get involved. The second reason is what if your actually good at the extracurricular activity, I know most kids are based on research. The last reason why I agree with my principal is that it can take away your negative emotions and turn them to some positive emotions. Most kids gain stress by playing video games all day and not doing or taking an activity outside of school. Here are the steps you should take to just be a better person in general. First get up and when you go to school get a flier about some extracurricular activity. It doesnt have to be the best activity ever, but it could be something small like serve as a student council or work on the school yearbook, there are an endless amount of extracurricular activities to take part in. The last step is to just sign up for that activity and have fun while doing it. In addition, if you dont want to take part in an extracurricular activity in school, then you can do one out of school Like you can get a membership to a gym, or you can tryout for any sports team your interested in. Just make sure you dont stay at home all day and play video games.\n",

      "Error processing text: By the age of 3, parents send their tots to preschool, a place for kids to experience and learn outside of their homes. These small children learn to listen, behave, and, most importantly, socialize with other kids their age. With these social abilities, the kids are sent to kindergarden, a slightly bigger classroom in order for greater socialization and assimilation. What follows is middle school, then the largest, high school. However, with the rise of technology, an increase in a gamechanging kind of education has been popularized Online schooling. At an alarming rate, students have turned to this alternative in order to remain in the comfort of their own home. This comfort only goes so far at what point does comfort turn into isolation? Through a screen, kids cannot nearly reach the needed amount of socialization and experience that regular, outofthehouse schooling provides. Students would not benefit from the ability to take classes online as it hinders not only their social abilities, but also future job performance. Students who attend school on a daily basis learn the basic social skills necessary for a job. Whether it's relationships with cowrokers or bosses, these types of social skills help one keep up their career, something in which their livlihood depends on. Schooling provides knowledge on how to treat a boss. For example, in the memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, Angelou claims that she skipped school in order to provide labor to her family business. When she got her first job as a housemaid at the age of 14, she had never experienced the discipline of a real teacher, a problem that also comes with online schooling. A few days into the job, Angelou broke numerous plates in spite of her unfair boss, but failed to realize the repercussions that would follow. If Angelou had attended real schooling, it's evident that she would be familiar with punishments that come with misbehaving, and likey would not have been fired. For online school, without a true disciplinary figure, kids could become just as naive as Angelou in the workplace. Outsideofthehouse school also teaches young adults about the social importance of punctuality. For example, for three years I've been the pianist for the school jazz band. Arriving to school at 730am every Wednesday is draining, however I've learned that if I'm late, I will get in trouble by not only my band director, but I will have also have let down all my bandmates. This has taught me to always be punctual to my hostessing job at a local resteraunt, knowing that if I fail to show up, I will have let down my coworkers. Such activites, that require punctuality, are not a factor of online schooling. Since punctuality is a necessary aspect of a job, students need to learn the trials and tribulations of punctuality in order to refrain from minimizing their good relations with coworkers and bosses in order to keep their jobs. Online school will not provide students with proper skills in forming regular friendships. Healthy marriage, family, and peer relationships all are the product of how we learned to get along with others in the schooling days of our adolesance. For example, in the novel Into the Wild by John Krakauer, outdoorsman Chris McCandless, from Annadale, VA, attended public school all the way until high school. Throughout his jounrney into the midwest, he credits all his friendships made along to journey to the ones that he made in Annadale. Always a social man, unlike other outdoorsman, McCandless learned to form bonds, for example the lifelong bond with elderly man Franz, in which they remained friends throughout the his journey. At resturaunts and bars across the west coast, workers claimed that McCandless had outstanding charisma compared to other wanderers. Other outdoorsmen who travel the west typically don't have the same social skills as they've been isolated from the world their whole lives. To compare it to online schooling, kids most likely will not gain the skills to form lifelong friendships if they are in isolation from the outside world, just like a typical outdoorsman. Also, with online schooling, students may have a harder time with future girlfriendboyfriend relationships later in life as they've been isolated from their own age group for the majority of adolesance. My grandmother, being an only child and homeschooled living in the rural part of Louisiana, told me about the trials and tribulations of her finding my grandfather. Because she was so isolated from her own age group, she wasn't sure of how to properly act around men her age. Fifteen years of being an adult landed her next to my grandfather, but it was only after a long, hard single life that she was able to keep down the right one. Online school would have kids delaying their relationships due to lack of social interaction around peers their age, making it difficlult to find a solid relationship. Others may disagree and claim that the online schooling resources, such as skype, will provide students with the social interaction they need outside of their own families. While skyping does provide some interaction, learning through a screen will never provide students with the same studentteacher bond that is necessary for building mentortype relationships in the future. More importantly, with only a teacher, where is the peer interaction? Kids learn content most efficiently when interacting with other peers on a daiy basis. For instance, in AP chemistry, notably one of the hardest classes my school has to offer, the teacher assigns group work every day after learning a new subject. When I work on the content with my peers, they provide me with easier shortcuts and alternatives than what my teacher taught. With Skype, no peers are present to help a student with a touchy subject. There is just the teacher, and only what's in that teacher's brain can be offered to the student.\n",

      "Error processing text: When going into middle school and high school, most students have the opportunity to pick extra curricular activities such as sports, art, student council, and much more. These activities give them a chance to incorporate their interested into their schedules. These classes are also often beneficial to the teenage mind while they are trying to grow and explore themselves. However, should extracurricular activities should be required? Without extra curricular activities, it is harder for teens to have the opportunity to be apart of their community. They also help teens branch out, be creative, and make new friends. Extracurricular activities gives students more independence and freedom to structure their own schedules, which can get pretty busy and full of school work! Some teens, however, don't see the benefit of extracurricular activities during middle school or high school and still need a little push to get involved. Students should be required to take an extracurricular activities because, it forces them to be an active citizen who is part of the community, it gives them an opportunity to take their mind off of school, and it pushes them to go out of their comfort zone and try something new. Requiring teens to take an extra curricula activity will help them become more involved in their school and local community, which is an important part of their lives. The average school community is made mostly of the student, so their involvement in the school is vital, even more so then the teachers. Not only does extracurricular activities help in school involvement, but it gets teens a head start to be involved in their local communities too. For example, some high school cheer leading teams not only cheer at school sports events, but cheer at town or county events. Also, lots of school art classes have their students work displayed at local shows or even just around the school building. In addition to that, lots of musical groups preform at school concerts and go to state competitions. These are only a few of the options, but almost all extracurricular activities work to get their students involved in the community. By enforcing extracurricular activities you enforce an involved lifestyle at a young age which is a skill teens can carry with them for the rest of their lives. Not only do extracurricular activities make students lives part of the community, but takes their minds of of their stressful school life. After a long day in school students are often forced to go home and do even more school work. Teens minds are consistently on school, grades, tests, and homework. School can create an unhealthy amount of stress, especial for teens who are still growing up. It is also easy to get sucked into over working and over worrying about grades and a good GPA. Having extracurricular activities normally gives them at least an hour of time to destress themselves every day. Not only do they get this time to distress, but also to put their energy into something they love! It is a huge change from sitting in a classroom trying to pay attention all day. Student need this time and this outlet do things that make them happy. Requiring extracurricular activities will give all student the chance to destress and take their minds off school work, especially when it becomes unhealthily over whelming. Lastly, requiring teenagers to branch out and try something new threw extracurricular activities can introduce them to new opportunities and teach them a valuable life lesson. Teens often fear trying something new or coming out of their shells. These fear often come from the fear of not being accepted or the fear of failure. Unfortunately, while trying to figure out how to fit in, teens can take the wrong path and become a bully or put themselves in danger. Extracurricular activities teaches them how to try new thing in a safe way. Breaking the ice between groups of people can be very hard and is something that most teens fear they will fail at, but it becomes a lot easier when they all share common hobbies. Extracurricular groups are like built in friends, or at least a group of people that have shared interests. Learning how to try new things, even tough it might seem scary is an important lesson that will helps teens for the rest of their lives. In conclusion, extra curricular activities will teach teens how to branch out and try new things, a skill that they will use even in adulthood. Teaching teens how to become part of their community, take their mind off of school, and try new things, are all benefits to requiring students to take at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities force kids to not only be involved at school, but locally in their town and city. They also let kids have a built in break from the stress that school brings. Finally, they teach kids the valuable life lesson of trying new things. Most teens are just trying to figure out who they are before being thrown into the life of adult hood. For many, however, they don't want to identify as the average teen who sits in a classroom all day. It is important to give students things like extracurricular activities so they can celebrate what makes them unique. Extracurricular activities aren't just a club or a group of people, it is an outlet to be yourself.\n",

      "Error processing text: Classrooms in this time period are filled with hightech computers and new innovations that are useful to teachers and students. It seems like every month something new is added to classrooms that can help stimulate learning. Some of these new inventions are something that no one would of ever imagined. That's what makes them so appealing and why people grab them off shelves the first chance they can. This technology, you can't quite grab off the shelves, but it is something that is worth installing. This new software, Facial Action Coding SystemFACS, relys on facial muscles to identify what emotions someone is feeling. One can only imagine all the different possibilities someone could have with this software, but a major possibility is installing it in classrooms. This technology would be useful to have in classrooms because it can advance learning, prevent bullying, and help identify mental disorders. There are countless times, when one starts to daze and daydream instead of paying attention in the classroom. Daydreaming is just so much better then having a teacher talk about spectator ions and how iconic compounds can be net or not. However, this new technology,FACS, could be very useful in the classroom for this reason. The reason being is that it can advance learning like we never would of thought. This computer would have the ability to stimulate lessons that would keep kids enterained and focused. In turn, they would be more likely to learn more and retain the knowledge. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or boredD'Alto. If this computer sensed that the child was becoming unfocused, it could do something about it, unlike teachers who sometimes don't always catch when a student is falling asleep or daydreaming. However, this computer would know and it could fix the issue right away so the child would be learning throughout the day. Since the computer keeps the child focused and learning for a longer amount of time, the child would have the ability to become more intelligent because it would be spending more time learning. This could lead to all different sorts of opportunities for the child, like special education programs, scholarships, etc. Bullying is a serious issue. It can sometimes be hard to spot and to solve, and no matter how hard people try, it never goes away. It's always there in the hallways of some schools, lurking over some and haunting them. Yet, what if there was a way to reduce bullying in a big way? Well, now there is with the help the FACS. FACS could reduce bullying because it would be able to identify if, for an extended period of time, a child was feeling sad andor scared. Then a teacher would know something is up. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions...D'Alto. Since this software can recognize mixed emtions, it would be able to tell if a child was showing the side effects of being bullied. By recognizing that if a child is being bullied, would help the child because they could talk to an adult and hopefully the problem would be solved. Also, if bullies knew that this software was in schools, then they would be less likely to bully because there would be a greater likeliness of them being caught. Overall, lower levels of bullying would result in higher selfesteem and confidence which then can be reflected in acedemics. Everyday kids walk through the halls of school and feel like they are totally alone in how they feel. They feel like they will have to live the rest of their lives feeling the way they do, and they become hopeless. This effects their acedemics because they are less focused and might not care how they do in school. However, if FACS was installed in schools, maybe kids could get the help they need. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking on her faceD'Alto. In some cases, this quote might be true. However, when it comes to having a mental disorder, most friends can't just guess how their friend is feeling. This is where FACS would come into play. This system would be able to know how a child is feeling and then, if those emotions are typically out of the range of what a normal teenager might be feeling, they could be sent to a professional. This professional could then diagnose the teenager whose been feeling this way and possibly have therapy. Overall, they would help them so they will feel better. After all this is done, and the teenager starts feeling better and being able to focus on school, their acedemics could skyrocket. With all the new inventions and innovations that have been becoming known to society throughout the years, FACS is one of them that could have a postive affect on the public and, more specifically, classrooms. This technology would have the ability to advance learning by sensing when a child is losing interest and then change the lesson to keep them entertained and continue learning. It could also prevent bullying by knowing when a child has been feeling a certain way for a long time, and then other mearures could be taken to help the child. Lastly, this technology could help children with mental disorders figure out why they feel the way they do and educate them about it, while also helping them not to feel that way anymore. Overall, this technology belongs in the classroom because it could solve problems that end up helping teenagers acedemics and result in opportunities to advance the child further.\n",

      "Error processing text: All my life I have grown up with older people, people who are at least forty or higher. They have given me all sorts of advice, good and bad. Asking for different advice can even change, for example, your perspective on the world. You can probably see the world in this nasty or horrific way, but there can be someone right in front of you who loves the world, and they know it has problems, but they look on the positive side. The three main reasons I look for advice is because there are three things I want to be able to get from what was given to me. One of them is what I just said, I want to see the world in a different way, if you've seen me in public, if I see a shady looking person, I start curl my fist into a ball, I want to be able to see the world in a different light. Second, taking advice from people who lived for a long time can lead you into the right direction. Third, it can help you and your future family if you have one because you will have this advice you got growing up and you want to help your family. You'll be able to tell them all of this and hopefully lead them in the right direction. Just to show you what I mean, I'm going to get into more detail. Not to long ago my family, best friend, and I went out to go eat at Subway and when we got back into the car there was a man behind with all gold teeth, as soon as I saw him I didn't trust him because of his teeth and I started making a fist. Reasons like this is why I'm always trying to get advice from different people, I've seen how screwed up our world is right know and I've had trouble trusting people in public, what my parents always tell me is to welcome everyone. I know I should be following what they have told because I've done that my whole life, that's the reason I try my best not to cuss, I will sometimes say words like that, but I still try my best not to. Like I said, getting advice from a lot of different people can help you get a different outlook in life, so try taking advice everyone once in a while. You can get advice from lots of different people, it can be good, or it can be bad. In elementary school I got into deep trouble because this guy was messing with someone else, I told him to stop, but he just started picking on me, but since I was in elementary school, he said something that caused me to break, so when he started to turn around, I picked up a rock and I chucked it at his back, luckily it missed, but I still got in trouble. The reason I did that was because my brother said if they hurt you, even with words, hit them back, that's some bad advice I followed. That's why I say right now, take advice that will lead you into the right direction, advice that won't cause any trouble, in middle school I'm surprised I haven't gone insane yet because there are some kids I want punch in the face because they mention race or call people names, but there is some advice I've been told that keeps me calm. One is these guys are my age, they can say what they want, but they are still my age, they can't do anything about it. Another is in the future I probably won't even see these guys, so once I tell myself that, I start to feel better and I show them that I could care less to what they are saying. In other words, if you get advice that can do good for you, that's advice that can stick with you, that could be advice that makes you a path and leads you into the right direction. Lastly, if you have kids in the future you can can gather up everything that's been said to you, and you can save for later. My mom always used to tell me about her grandmother. Once upon a time, there was a civil war that broke out in the country of Generic_City, and my grandmother died and my mom's dad left earlier to the United States. In the end it was just my mom, her siblings, and her grandmother. My mom would always tell the story that one day during the war, there were soldiers walking around and they happen to stumble upon my mom's grandma's house. My great grandmother opened the door, looked at the soldiers, and told them to come in. My great grandmother got up got them a glass of water and got some food and told them stories, and even though they had guns right there in their hands, they finished their food and water got up and left. My family has always been a family who has lived by the bible, to my family that's the greatest advice you can get, even me, so because of that story my mom always told me she has put her life on the bible and now she's a pastor of Generic_City United Methodist Church. I know I'm talking about a lot of Christianity, but because of Christianity, her faith went up, and she used the advice she was given, from her grandmother and the bible, and passed it down onto us. What I'm saying here is, with all the advice that has been given to you, you can use that advice and pass it down to your kids if you have any, then they could pass it on to their kids and it could keep on going throughout the generations. Advice can really go a long way if you get advice that sticks with you your entire life. In conclusion, the fact how people told me advice really took me a long way, if I would've stuck the person who wasn't given any of this advice, my grades would suck real bad, I don't think I would even be I school right now, and I my life would've sucked, but just because I put my head up and listened to a lot of people, it made who I am today. I'm not saying go out and follow all of the advice you were given, I'm just saying consider it, if you think this is what you need, try get that piece of advice and keep it with you at all times. The advice I have been given is what I just explained, getting a different outlook in life, so that way I can trust people more, being able to get good advice and follow it to the point where I've accomplished what I need to, and lastly, take the advice I've been given and pass it on to everyone. Some of stuff in this prompt is really cheesy, but it's true. Advice can take you a long way.\n",

      "Error processing text: Visualize this a student has been suffering for months on end from depression. Every day, he is hesitant to attend school, as he knows the stressful environment exacerbates the symptoms of his depression. When he speaks to his principal about taking time off from school, his principal presents an even better solution taking classes from home. As soon as the student begins his classes online, he notices a shift in his mental health. He actually enjoys learning. This is only one example of the benefits classes online could present. There is actually a myriad of benefits for students that results from them attending classes from home, including aiding students in maintaining their health, more exclusive teaching that is comfortable for all, and providing a way for students to learn while giving them time to attain their goals. This method of learning may be more helpful now than ever. At a time where such a great epidemic the Coronavirus is present, students risk spreading the disease when they are compelled to go to school despite being ill. However, there is no way for them to remain home and keep up with schoolwork. This fear of being unable to attend school and still keeping up with their course load is one that plagues many students. Personally speaking, I can reference numerous students who have felt dangerously ill on school days, but were so afraid of missing tests and presentations that they still came. They felt that if they even missed one day, they would have missed salient lessons, causing their work to pile up, resulting in stress. Providing an alternate method for these students to learn, such as online classes, would have mitigated their concerns. This logic pertains to mental health as well. It is common knowledge that the mental health of adolescents in this generation is declining, and the most prominent reason is school. Online classes provide an avenue for students who feel their mental health is worsening to still receive an education but from a place of comfort, which is their home. Additionally, simply put, some students may just learn better in an online environment. Attending a school with thousands of students is not necessarily the most desirable environment for every student, not every day. Students are forced to learn in classrooms with another 2030 students. Some students have trouble concentrating with so many of their peers present. There will be less people at a time in online classes, so they can learn better and acquire a better grasp on concepts, as there are less distracting factors. The primary benefit, however, is for students with social anxiety, those who feel intimidated by the presence of others, which is more common than one might think. Those who say social anxiety can be reduced by being around large quantities of people at a time do not understand the mechanisms of anxiety. Sometimes time is the best remedy being forced to indulge in conversation with their peers will only be an obstacle to students with anxietyrelated issues. This obstruction is eliminated in distance learning. Furthermore, though the specific details of online school have not been listed, such as the duration of classes, it can be assumed that class length will be dependent upon the student. For example, if a student's schedule is comprised of Algebra II, Biology, US History, and English Language and Composition, if the student is strong in math, he or she will likely speed through the course, allotting more time to the other subjects. If the online classes are based upon pace, students can get through subjects quicker, rather than being forced to remain in a class for an hour and a half. This results in students having more time to engage in the activities they are passionate about while having more flexible schedules. Why is this significant? Well, for example, places like INOVA have volunteer programs for kids to help senior citizens that require people to work from 12 pm3 pm on weekdays. A regular student could not possibly participate in that program, regardless of how passionate he or she is about helping the elderly. Alternatively, if a student had an idea for a groundbreaking research project that he or she must complete in a lab, the student could devote more time to developing their procedure and collecting data than before. Attending school in person, regularly, will likely be an obstacle for these students, as a nearly 8 hour long school day with four hours of homework and mandatory extracurriculars does not leave sufficient time for the students to pursue their dreams. Now, some may argue that the subset of students previously mentioned is not representative of the majority of students, but that is information we will likely never know, as they are not permitted the time necessary to explore their interests. Perhaps there are many students with innovative ideas for research projects that lack the time for it. With the addition of online school, students might be able to devote more time to discovering their interests and pursuing them. Although there may be debate about the ways in which online school can be taken advantage of, people should learn to focus on the best in children and the online system, not their potential and minuscule disadvantages. Permitting students to attend classes from home has a variety of advantages. Among those, the most evident ones are that students can focus more of their time on their passions, learn better, and preserve their health without concern of missing class. Schools are meant to be a place where students can grow by obtaining knowledge and applying it. Whether classes are online or inperson should not matter greatly though online may actually be more helpful, as the outcome of an education will remain the same. Thus, experiencing learning via video conferencing and online resources is a solution to both improve the quality of education and the well being of students in the longterm.\n",

      "Error processing text: A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals. I used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them. Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments. Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself what is the point of doing all this?. I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right. In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.\n",

      "Error processing text: Since Henry Ford made the first Model T, people have been obsessed with the idea of transportation. This idea has evolved into many things between then and now. We now have entire sports dedicated to cars and motorcycles, cars powered by alternate energy sources, and many other novel concepts that have taken the world by storm. However, there are many potential advantages of limiting your use of our precious automobiles. One of the first reasons that you should reduce your usage of cars is found all around us, in the environment. Some statistics of the current amount of damage we cause by using our cars like we do include that fact that passenger cars are responsibel for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some areas of the United States. Imagine if we could reduce those numbers? David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America a fastgrowing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United states, said How much you drive is as important as whether you drive a hybrid. There are some places that are taking this concept to heart. One example of this is in Bogota, Columbia, where on certain days every year, a Day Without Cars in the captial city leaves only buses and taxis with permission to be on the roads. Despite the rain on the third time the event took place, the turnout was still great. There were even other cities, Cali and Valledupar, that took part in the fun. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic about what they saw. The country of Colombia has made a concious effort to reduce their carbon footprint since the mid1990s. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicicyle paths as well as parks and sports centers have also cropped up. This also in turn resulted in an improved economy as new restaurants and upscale shopping distrcits have cropped up. The current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has also recently unveiled ambitious goals to curb the US's greenhouse gas emmisions. Wouldn't it be great if we could all help the environment out by reducing our usage of cars? How great would it be, if at the same time as leanding the earth a helping hand, you were able to improve your own happiness? In Vauban, Germany and several other places globally, this has already begun to take effect. The people of this city are part of the Smart Planning movement. This experimental community on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders, is taking reducing autombile usage to a whole new level. Seventy percent of Vauban's families simply do not own a car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two living in Vauban, said When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, as she walked the verdant streetes where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering people drown out an occasional distant motor. The Smart Planning movement isn't just restricted to this place though. It is merely an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. In Bogota, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife, It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, on a Day Without Cars. Some may still say though, How if by giving up my car, will I be happier? I will have to find some other transportation mean and potentially have to wake up much earlier than I already to get everywhere. That seems more stressful to me. However, due to the recession in the US, many people are having to do adapt this type of lifestyle out of necessity. Many can't afford new vechiles but still must get to work somehow. Even after the recession ends, many sociologists believe that many will not return their previous way of life. Finally, there are already many plans in place to reduce automobile usage. At the Mobile World Congress in 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan that shows how impractical or undesireable it will be for many to own a vehicle. He also proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create ciries in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety. The Environment Protection Agency as well as legislators are promoting the reduced use of personal vehicles by working to induct a new sixyear federal transportation bill, rather than previous ones that have devoted about eighty percent of the appropriations have gone to highway improvements and the remaining twenty percent to other transport. To wrap everything up, there are many reasons that everyone should try to reduce automobile use. For one, it will help the environment, it will increase general happiness, and finally, that there are plans that are already in place to make it more feasable for people to adopt this new lifestyle. Whether we will see a drastic change or not, we will not know until we try. But that all starts, with you.\n",

      "Error processing text: Why is it important for the teachers to assign summer projects during the long summer break? It is important for the teacher to assign summer projects during long summer break, because it is assures that the students continues learning during the summer break. Summer break is a long break where students usually forget what they did and studied last year. So, it is better to for the teachers to assign summer projects, so the students can come better prepared and ready for the classes after a long summer break. Teacher designed projects are usually school appropriate, focuses more on the main idea, and easy for the teachers to grade the assignment. Teacher designed projects helps the students to focus on the main idea. It does not distract the students to go off the topic and focus more on what teacher wants and expects from us. It is also helps the students to fullfill the teachers requirement, for example In the future, it would help the college students because they would be more prepared and ready for it. College professors usually assign really hard projects so it would be hard and difficult for the students to do. They also wants us to not go off topic because they don't like students giving extra information that is useless. If students have multiple choices to work on, they usually get confused and don't know what topic is best for them to choose. It gets really hard for the students if they make their own choices so it is better for the teacher to assign or design a project that has been approved by the teachers department. Grading projects for the professor teachers is an easy task if the students chose to do the projects that they have assigned. If the students choose to design create the project on their own. It would be kind of hard for the teachers to grade the assignment. They might get confused on what the actual topic is and would not get a good grade unless you have enough information for the teacher to understand. For example, during the end of the sophomore year we got a research project to do to get a GPA boost. In order, to get the GPA boost I needed to do good on the research assignment. Me and my partner chose a topic that was not a teacher's choice topic and it was about testing goldfish in different water levels. The teacher told us that it would be a hard topic to choose as she did this sort of assignment during the college days before becoming a teacher. We both still chose to do it and took a risk, in the end most of the goldfish died during the experiment and our research assignment didn't went that well as we thought it would be. Me and my partner didn't receive a good grade, we got a B on the research project. After that I decided to always choose a topic that has been assigned by the teacher because they already been more experienced and chose what is easy for us to do. This year research assignment is assigned by our teacher and it is much more easier for us to do as it is assigned by the teacher and until now we have been getting good grades and just waiting for the final part to complete. It is better to always listen to your teachers point of view because it might help you in the future and you might end with a good grade, even you get your teacher's guidance for the project. Teachers designed projects are usually checked by the academies of Generic_School or the head of the teachers department to assure that it is school prohibited. Projects should be school appropriate because students usually choose topics that might not be appropriate for schools. Teachers professors knows best what school assignments are appropriate and what are not. If the project is not school appropriate, you might get a straight zero in your grade book and a comment written, it was not a school appropriate project that's why your kid got a zero on your report card. Studentdesigned project can be easy for them unless, it is school appropriate and meet the certain requirements that has been provided by the teacher. For example, in the show ''the vampire diaries, Generic_Name chose to do an assignment for a history project. It was about the witches and vampires and how they were created and how many are there. This was not a school appropriate project for a high school student to research about this kind of topic. So he received a zero on this assignment. Generic_Name teacher talked to him about the project and gave him a second chance to do a topic that is related to history. In conclusion, teacher designed projects are best for the students because it would help the students to focus more on what criteria to meet and what are our teacher's expectations. It would be much more easier for the teacher to grade and help us on the assignment that she has designed for us. Teacher would assign or create a project that would be useful for us in the future and might help us in many ways. Teacher creates an assignment that is school appropriate because if it is not school appropriate then you'll straight get a zero on the assignment. Teacher chooses the topic are easier and helpful in way for their students. Teachers assignments can sometimes be really hard and too difficult at times that you might get confused on what information to put and what not to. Though, some of the school requires the teacher's to design a project not the student's because it is out of schools law because if they do something wrong, the teacher gets into trouble. Teachers should give summer assignments to the students during summer break because it is very long break and children usually forget. So the teacher creates these assignments for the students to relearn and get more knowledge through projects that might help them in future or their career. However, I think that teachers should be the one designing the projects because it keeps the teacher assure that students are learning important information that might be helpful in their future.\n",

      "Error processing text: The concept of summer break presents many flaws to the school system. It causes students to lose vital information they learned the year prior and creates a lazy atmosphere with the absence of work. The clear solution to this is summer assignments and projects, yet some wonder who deserves to decide what the projects should consist of. Summer projects, a key tool to ensure continued enrichment, should be student designed to allow opportunities for creativity, increased enjoyment while working, as well as higher rates of motivation to continuously work on the project in order to nurture passion and a love for this work within students. During the school year teachers are obligated to obtain a set amount of grades and fit a certain curriculum, yet during summer these rules no longer apply. This leaves summer as the perfect time to allow for creativity with learning. One such example is the Sustainable Technology Class. This is a project driven class where students are given guidelines to fulfill and that is it. Many of the students taking this course have a passion for the material and need a chance to see all of the possibilities it can hold. With this class specific, originality could lead to a revolutionary invention, such as electricity generating bicycles or solar powered toys. Through this experience a student can truly fall in love with the world of science and decide to create a career out of it. A cpncept very similar to professors being able to do any research they can get approved within their budget. Also, including student led work could help school systems break the factory system pattern of the school year in which you do your assigned work and keep the classroom silent. Our current system, where students have very little say, easily leads to anxiety, exhaustion, and eventually, for some, fully dropping out of high school. By offering a chance to have a self designed, teacher approved project, students can fully appreciate knowledge in a way the benefits the individual. Once the door to creativity and choice has been opened, enjoyment has to follow. In 1800's France, a new style of art was emerging, impressionism. If these talented and famous painters, such as Monet and Van Gogh, solely followed the advice of their instructors and refused to step out to paint what they enjoy, we would not have beautiful works like Starry Night. If they had not branched out and followed their intuition and joy, they may never have continued painting due to constant belittlement of the art style they preferred. Our museums would be repetitions of the same work with very little diversity. This is true for essentially all art, another example of this is the Rock Revolution. If stars such as Elvis and the Beatles only followed the era of Big Band music and never were allowed to play and create what they enjoyed, music could have never evolved. With each generation, the world learns more and more. Advancements would never occur if every project was solely based off of the knowledge of the teacher. Finally, for the average student, September through June is an endless pattern of early mornings, tests, and work sheets created by their teachers. More importantly September through June is a pattern of procrastination for many students. Due to dread about a certain assignment or just plain boredom, work piles up and leaves the student to rush through it carelessly before the due date. A perfect example of this is Love Canal, New York. In the 1970's a community was built over a former dumping ground for radioactive waste. The families quickly noticed issues such as minor chemical burns from the grass and black sludge seeping into their houses, but the government ignored the growing tragedy. There was no action taken until 18 out of 21 children were born with severe chromosomal defects. By this point, the government was forced to spend thousands of dollars in relocating the families as well as reparations, hospital bills, and environmental recovery. If they had not procrastinated, then it would have been considerably less expensive and would not have been as horrific as it ended up being. While this example may not directly highlight the issues within teacher driven projects, it does show what a consistent habit of procrastination can lead to. Which is what the school system instills in students by not allowing decision making. It is undeniable that when people care about the project being done, they are will put time and energy into it through out the whole experience, not just the ending. While there are some benefits to teacher driven projects, such as the possibility for concise instructions and often an obvious path to follow, these just allow the students to be overly protected and lazy. This prevents the potential for growth that comes from creating something and succeeding in it without the help of an adult. It also instills the idea that there will always be someone telling you what to do. Which is very harmful once these students get to the work field. They will be unprepared due to never doing fully original and individual work, and the school system would be the one to blame. In our modern world, we need innovation more than anything else. Young minds need to be nurtured, but also allowed to follow their own path of individuality and creativity. The only way to ensure the growth of these important traits is to loosen the leash and allow students to make some of the decisions. It is just one project per year, but a country wide switch could be revolutionary.\n",

      "Error processing text: How many opinions do you need before you can make a decision? Well, I know that for me personally I ask many people their opinions about my situation and about what actions I should take before my final decision is made. That's just how most people are, they ask many people, they get many opinions, and then they decide which they think is best. However, most people probably don't know why they seek multiple opinions instead of just asking one person. So today I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't just ask one person's opinion because it's so much better to get multiple opinions from multiple different people. Asking many people for opinions can help you make better decisions because it allows you to see the situation from many different viewpoints, it helps you find out what the majority of people think, and it gives you the opportunity to deliberate what option is your best course of action based off many more than your own reasons. First, it allows you to see your situation from perspectives that aren't your own. When you just ask one person for their opinion on your situation, they might agree with you. But, you know what happens when you just ask one person and they agree with you you go with your gut feeling and if you do that then there was no point in asking for an opinion in the first place. However, if you ask multiple people for their opinions then you get many different perspectives, so you can see the situation through the eyes of the person you're fighting with, or running a business with, or having a baby with, etc. That way you can make the better choice because you can now see from the other person's view and understand why they are arguing against you. I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made. Secondly, it helps you find out what the majority of people think. To most people that sounds like a bad thing most people hear throughout their lives the words quality over quantity. Often times, this is true, especially when it comes to consumer goods. But, if the statement quality over quantity was always true, why is it not used on everything? Well, when it comes to opinions quality is only determined by your opinion of the opinion. That's why presidential elections use quantity not quality because opinions don't have an official quality. The same is applied to any survey or poll that exists, they all are based on the numbers. So, if the president, the leader of the country, is elected by numbers, why shouldn't you have your own little election when you are faced with a difficult decision and you can't decide what choice is better? Thirdly, if you ask multiple people for their opinions, you're going to get many reasons as to why they think that way. When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely selfcentered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful. At last, you've, hopefully, learned and realized why you shouldn't bother thinking about just asking one person for their opinion. You should ask multiple because with just one opinion you can't do anything. If you just ask one person you only get one opinion, and with one opinion you certainly can't find the majority because it's only one opinion. When you ask multiple people their opinions you can find the majority, if you don't want to go with the majority you can use the opinions to look at the situation from a different perspective, and if you don't want to do that just list all the reasons the people had behind their opinions and then decide, in your opinion, which reasons are good, logical reasons and what course of action do they support. Now, I ask you one question, how many opinions do you think you need before you can make a decision?\n",

      "Error processing text: Education has been taught through traditional classroom settings for centuries. The moment that school bell rings to signal the start of the school day, students prepare for their day of learning. Without that important aspect of education, students can slack off. With video conferencing, the students are in a place they consider to be relaxing. The attempt to learn through a video conference at home would not be time spent well by the students. Most people wouldn't take the situation seriously and proceed to fool around. Students would not benefit from online conferencing at home because of the ambiance of the school that provides students with an environment meant for learning, the social interactions that are created with fellow peers, and the idea that the method can be taken advantage of. School is a location where students spend roughly six hours learning and an hour for walking to class and lunch time in Generic_City. The environment contributes greatly to the likelihood that students want to learn while they are at school. Especially since technology has advanced so much in the last couple of decades, teachers can teach students in many unique ways. That facetoface interaction with the teacher can help students learn in depth rather than staring at a computer screen. People value experiences where they were taught something magnificent and the feeling that resulted while sitting in that classroom. That feeling will never be able to replicate from a student starting at a computer. There was this moment in class when I really thought that this teacher had a great ability to teach and cared how her students were absorbing the information and not just memorizing for an exam. My science teacher in seventh grade spent time making foldables, activities, and experiments that were not only interesting, but related to the topic that we were learning. She taught us a lesson every class that could be used when we enter the reality of life after college. One time we were learning about the history of DNA. She spoke of how a female scientist died not knowing that her discovery in science became historic in the development of other topics. She noticed the connection that people were mistreated and advised us all to be aware that in the real world, ideas are stolen, but we should advocate for the truth. Every student in Generic_City has heard of a PBL Project Based Learning. Administrators of public schools have implemented these assignments that require the effort of multiple people working together to come up with an amazing result. If the Board of Education cares so deeply about the benefits of students working together, so should we. With the online conferencing method of learning, students wouldn't have that interaction that is so crucial to work in the real world. During these PBLs, students learn to compromise, share ideas, and work through disagreements. These experiences come in handy when at work someone is placed in a group that they don't know and is expected to work together to find a solution for a problem. Recently, the Corona Virus COVID19 has become one of the most deadly diseases historically. Scientists, from all over the world, have banded together in an attempt to find something that would help slow down the transmission of the disease or even a working cure. The message of teamwork and collaboration is an idea that has been stressed for decades. For example, during WWII, the atomic bomb was in the midst of its creation. The Allies U.S., Britain, France, etc. sent over their scientists to the U.S. to work on the Manhattan project a project that's goal was the creation of an atomic bomb. Collaboration in the educational environment can't be substituted by a video on a computer screen. Anything that requires technology can be manipulated. The idea of online conferencing could be done, but the actual use of it wouldn't accomplish anything. In order of getting out of school online conferencing, students could think of a million reasons why they weren't there for their online conferencing. This could include losing their computer, not having internet, being busy for some reason, and etc. It's complicated enough that some students can leave during the school day, but this online conferencing would give students even more leeway to get out of their education. People agree that in some circumstances, students can't physically be able to attend school. Whether there was an accident or a student was sick and contagious for weeks, maybe online conferencing would benefit them. In the past, before online conferencing was suggested, schools have already dealt with this issue. Usually, students will get their work ahead of time or periodically and then when they are able to return to school, they catch up with the teacher's assistance. In the end, that person should recover nicely. Once my friend was sick on and off for three weeks. She was taking four college level classes and three advanced classes. When she was at home, she took the initiative to tell all her teachers and get the work. Sometimes, I would call her and ask if she needed me to explain anything. The traditional way to learn is perfectly fine for students. All situations can be resolved to help a student that's facing hardships. Some college students have mentioned that nine out of ten times, high school was an experience they wouldn't trade for anything else, even with the bad times. Those memories of attending school events like pep rallies, homecoming, prom, game nights and more wouldn't have even happened without traditional education. The connections that are forged including friendships and romance. All of those are created because education was made to be a creative environment where students learn and are happily doing so. The benefits of a traditional learning environment clearly outweigh learning through a computer screen.\n",

      "Error processing text: Imagine if there was an option to get a quality education without the need to actually go to school, imagine not having to deal with crowded hallways, obnoxious students, or blaring school bells. Actually, there is an option like that. Some schools offer the option of allowing students to attend school online by video conferencing or by being in an online class. This has sparked a debate with people wondering whether this option of taking online classes is beneficial to students or not. One side of the argument says that taking online classes is beneficial because it's convenient and there will be less negative social interactions between students. The other side of the argument states that students taking online classes is not beneficial because students will have less social interaction all together and because technology shouldn't be relied on so much when it comes to an education. I believe that getting an education online is not beneficial to students because of the lack of social interaction and because technology shouldn't be the most crucial object for a student's education. Firstly, online classes aren't helpful because students who take online classes do not get the same social needs met as a student that physically goes to school. A student in an online class will have a lesser chance of meeting others. Meeting people and making friends is one the key aspects of going to school, besides getting an education, and students and kids need to be meeting people and learning how to interact with others. Humans are social creatures, we need to be talking, seeing, and meeting with people. If kids are built on rarely communicating with others, then there will be a higher chance of them being more socially anxious as young adults. Another reason why a student that goes to school online will not have their social needs met is because they won't experience arguments as much. While there is positive interaction, there is also negative interaction. As terrible as it feels when people experience it, a rare argument is actually good. It teaches kids what is accepted and what isn't by the way that the person reacts to it. For example, you get in trouble and scorned if you have a physical fight with someone after an argument, But if you react to an argument in good fashioned way then you will get praised and nothing bad will come your way. Furthermore, if a student that takes online classes gets a job where they are met with a negative interaction, they might not react in a way another student might. Lastly, people going to an online school will not get the same social interaction from teachers. While students that go to school have a teacher that is physically there to help, online students do not. This might make online schooling harder for the student because they won't have that same interaction with a teacher as a regular student would have. Plus, not having a teacher there next to you to show you how to do something might be hard for most students. So, online schooling is not beneficial to students because they will have limited social interactions like meeting and connecting with others, not experiencing negative social interactions, and not having the same social help with teachers. Lastly, online classes aren't beneficial to students because technology has limits. There is always a risk of damaging the laptop a student is using to take the online classes. Accidents happen, but while the laptop is getting fixed the student will most likely start to fall behind on work. An accident shouldn't be a reason for someone beginning to fail a class. Another reason why technology is limited is because of internet and wifi. Some students may not have access to good internet and wifi because of their home and living situation, this will just make video conferencing more of a hassle than a helpful. Finally, the technology that the kids use for the online classes might be used irresponsibly. Some might use it to play games or watch videos, teens will be like that. Online schooling is not helpful because of technology limits like broken tech, not everyone has access to wifi, and others might not use it for it's intended purpose. Some people may argue that online classes are good for students because of lack of negative interaction and its convenience. Bullying and fights can really harm students, I agree with that statement. But learning behind a computer screen shouldn't be the solution we choose. We can try to improve the school system or promote telling teachers and trusted ones if someone is getting bullied. Just because there is negative interaction doesn't mean we should limit interaction entirely. Also, the convenience not going on the school bus everyday and walking through loud hallways is compelling. That is also a fair point, but, charging chrome books everyday and running the risk of it breaking isn't any more convenient than a crowded hallway. Despite these points, I still believe that online classes are not helpful to students because we can better the school system with bullying problems and charging and always running the risk of damaging something isn't convenient. Online classes are not beneficial to students because of the lack of social interactions and because of the fact that technology has limits. Students physically going to school is great for their well being, getting to interact with and make bonds with people is important in our daily lives. Technology shouldn't be used as the only mean to education, while technology can play an important role to a student's education, it should not be the main object to do so.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear state senator, There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens. As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote. However, even though there have been a few problems in the past about this system, the Electoral College is still the best method of voting. It is hard to argue that there are some problems with the Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Bradford Plumer. The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense. Richard A Posner. The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Bradford Plumer. The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want and it has happened a few times in the past. 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Bradford Plumer. That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.Bradford Plumer. The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time. However, despite the worries and concerns that some people may have, the Electoral College is still the best method for voting. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote. the Office of the Federal Register. People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.Richard A. Posner. This system also can often prevent disputes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote. Richard A. Posner. Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Richard A. Posner. Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. Voter in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Richard A. Posner. Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Richard A. Posner. And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid runoff elections. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. Richard A. Posner. To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College. All and all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids runoff elections and it makes the voters more aware, some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.\n",

      "Error processing text: In the generation we are living in today cars are a huge part of our everyday lives. Whether it's going to schoolwork, hanging with friends or anywhere really people rely on their cars for everything and you never hear anyone talk about walking, biking and taking another way of transportation. It's whole new era with how are society is created and working but it's how we are living, and it seems to be working. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky all have the same mindset when talking about cars while each are talking about a different reason to decrease car usage, they all have a common interest in wanting it to be implied or simply like how it is being enforced. So after reading very specific, factual, and information articles I now know the advantages of limiting car usage and that is to save time and businesses, conserve resources, and having a vast decrease in car culture. Imagine yourself on a bad morning, you woke you late and you're probably rushing out the door for work, and as a fellow American I would know that there is early morning traffic no matter where you are headed. But if you didn't use a car and maybe walked or rode a bike you could easily get there faster if it was a reasonable distance. In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets fo this capital city eerily to devoid of traffic jams Selsky, par 20. This goes to show that when people took other steps to get to work instead of cars that there was no traffic jams. Which means no waitng which also means getting to work at a normal time, or for some, even on time. When you think about it you know that the roads can be a really busy and hetic place to be if you time it just right, so if you take the extra measure and maybe walk home you can easily make faster time and not just that but it helps the environment. Now another advantage of not using cars is businesses start to flourish. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Selsky, par 28. Since many people have decided not to use their cars they walk or bike and that can lead to going to places near by which would mean they see more of their city than they did in a car. More eyes are to catch businesses and they find themselves walking into a store because they aren't rushed andor it might just look intersting which is a huge benefit for companies. Secondly, another advantage on limiting car usage would be conserving resources. This is a very major step when it comes to the environment and things like these should be enforced for a greener Earth. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Rosenthal, par 5. This is damaging our Earth and the only to prevent it is to limit your car use. Because how it's happening and how it's polluting our Earth is from the cars tailpipes when it releases the exhaust. Due to this hazardly problem laws are starting to be made to limit the use. Towns and cities have tried to come up with a nodriving day to decrease the use and help the environment, and in many cases it has worked while in some, it hasn't. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Duffer, par 10. In effect to this 'experiment' it is shown that this way of thinking had changed Paris pollution decreased and congestion in traffic was down and the smog that was being created by cars had stopped the next couple of days. It's unbelievable to know what can happen when you limit yourself. Finally, it is clear that there is a decrease in car culture. There have been recent studies that imply that more Americans aren't driving or just plain out don't want to get their licenses. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009... Rosenthal, par 41. We aren't really understanding as to why this is happening. Maybe it's because they are afraid of getting a ticket, their parents haven't allowed it, they are against pollution it's not known. But what we do know is that yes, it's saving the environment but it's hurting the car businesses. If the pattern presists and many sociologists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants Rosenthal, par 34. Yes, this is going to increasingly better our enivornment by not having more cars on the road to pollute, but it will for sure hurt the car industry. Not many people even have the money to go out a buy a car in this economy. And from the car businesses in ruins, some are even rebranding themselves. The change in car culture is known for much less commuting due to technology as well. Lastly, a reminder of the advantages in limiting car usage are saving time and businesses, conserving resources and a decrease in car culture. So when you're on the road, start thinking about ways to stop your use of cars and see how it would benefit the environment cause the more we drive around the worse our Earth will become.\n",

      "Error processing text: intro and hook and thesis body body body conclusion restating thesis prompt is expository From the minute we are born we are taught to always talk to a parent or guardian if we have an issue. But there are so many other people you could go to that would save you so much time and effort and they would give the exact same response as your parents. I believe you should always go to a separate opinion from that of your parental guardian and what you will find when you do so, is these other sources can teach you a lot more than your family and they have different experiences from those of your parents. your parents will always want the best and nothing more from you but think to yourself, do my parents really care about my issue or are they just trying to make me feel better about the problem at hand. So when you are done talking to your parents your decision is not made any easier, truthfully it's become a lot more challenging. Because you have been told what you expected them to say it's not helpful and you are disappointed. I believe a great reason for going to another opinion for help is the fact that they won't sugarcoat the truth from you. They may not know you as well as your parents do and it could ultimately benefit you to hear the hard truth about the matter at hand. When you get constructive criticism from a peer it allows you to do a self evaluation on your problems and the different solutions you could use to solve your problems. That peer will always want the best out of you because it may be a close friend and they will understand you a bit better and they will always tell you your problem and try to help you understand what is wrong and what you should do. When you go to a second opinion you have to look back and think if you held back anything when you were talking to them, and if you didnt than you should expect them not to hold any of their emotions or feelings about the problem to you. Another good reason for you to go seek a second opinion is that, they will always want to listen and seek understanding about your problems. If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of oh honey it's ok you will be fine and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier I believe that when you go to an alternative opinion about a concern they can show you a different perspective of the situation at hand. Which then helps you become a better problem solver in general and having that skill can make some of the tough decision seem very easy. The moment your eyes become fully opened to the different outcomes of what you could say or do based on a simple decision. You start to almost think more logically when you are given the task of answering the hard questions about yourself and you realize that all the decisions you make, impacts you and only you so don't worry about someone else when making a decision about your livelihood. This will ultimately always end up as a better decision because you took the time to hear another way of solving the issue and you can factor that into your decision making and how you will handle the problem you needed to get advice about. I personally have always believed in the idea of going to a second opinion about an issue and I always want to help people with their problems just like they help me with mine. You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian. Finally when you make your ultimate decision based on the advice you were given you are very well informed and you can learn the different perspectives and different lessons that can be taught by different people and you come out of the experience so much wiser and smarter than you ever were before. That is why I believe going to a second opinion is beneficial towards your decision making and ultimately will help you in the long run with whatever issues arise.\n",

      "Error processing text: Today, the effect of summer break on students is debated as frequently as politics. Many are convinced that this long break causes students to forget material that they have just learned. Schools have tried to combat this issue in various ways one way is to require summer projects. This would assure that students continue learning during their break. However, this solution begs the question of if these projects should be designed by the teachers or the students. Certainly, these projects should be left to the teacher. Summer projects should be teacherdesigned to reduce the unnecessary amount of time spent on the project and stress on the students, insure the relevancy the project has to the course, and guarantee the teacher's help and structured guidelines. First, if summer projects are teacherdesigned, the amount of unnecessary time spent on the project and stress would reduce for the students. The time needed to plan and form a project would be solely on the teacher, not each individual student. This entire process can be very stressful and overwhelming, especially for a student who does not have a degree in the subject. The stress and frustration would continue, especially if a student cannot get approval. A studentdesigned project would require the student to present their project idea to the teacher for approval. Whereas a teacherdesigned project would already be approved, eliminating the hassle of the first few steps in the project making process. For example, a high school student, Generic_Name, is going into an advanced science class. She has the idea to do a project where she will conduct a survey asking different people to pick their preferred flower from a list. The teacher denies her request because it does not reflect the class level. Generic_Name then has to go back and start from square one, frustrated and angry. A student may have to go back again and again, especially frustrated because it is wasting valuable time in the middle of their summer. Second, teacherdesigned projects would be relevant to the course. Students would be unaware of the topics related to the course they are going into, for they have not studied it yet. It would be impossible for them to form a beneficial project related to the subject. A teacher could use this project as a precursor to the unit they will study first, beginning to teach right when they get back to school. The students will have some background on the topic, ready to jump in. The students will then be able to have class discussions on the topic, because they all did the same project and are on the same page. For example, Generic_Name is a rising senior in high school going into an American literature class. He is told that he must complete a project over summer. He decides to read a biography on George Washington and do a report on the book. He has no idea that the first unit in the class is poetry. It would have been more beneficial to Generic_Name and the other students in that class if the teacher was able to assign the project. The teacher could have given the students many Edgar Allen Poe poems and assigned a thrilling project to go along with the mysterious and captivating works of Poe. Coming back from summer break, the class could discuss what they read and share their projects with each other. Having a teacher design a relevant project would unify the class and be a wonderful bridge to aid in the transition from summer into a new school year. Lastly, clear guidelines and the teacher's help would be guaranteed if teachers design summer projects. With the teacher designing the project, they could make a clear and distinct rubric. This would inform students exactly what the teacher is looking for. It is very difficult to complete a project when you are not sure how it will be graded. Teachers would be able to help students and answer any questions they may have. For example, over the summer, Generic_Name has an assignment to research her favorite U.S. president and write a paper on their life. The teacher provides an over view of the assignment, a list of all the requirements, and a rubric. Generic_Name would like to add a page on the president's children. However, she is not sure if that is allowed, considering that the assignment was only on the president himself. She sends an email to her teacher and asks her question. The teacher is able to answer her question almost immediately, because the teacher knows exactly what they want. The teachers should formulate the projects, so they can assist the students and guide them. Some may argue that studentdesigned projects allow students to have creativity, individuality, and freedom. As a result of these things, students would be more inclined to complete the project however, these selfassigned projects could easily be swept under the rug, especially in the midst of an exciting summer break. More time, thought, and preparation must go into a student designed project, discouraging students from setting aside appropriate time to devote to the project, because they view it as too challenging. In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers. This would be more beneficial to both students and teachers. The teachers would be able to assign projects that are relevant to their lesson, relating their summer work to the unit they will be studying first, allowing them to be able to start learning as soon as they get back to school. During the months of summer break, the last thing that students want is the stress of a project. It would be much easier and less stressful if the teachers designed the project to reduce the amount of preparation needed from the students. The teachers would give the students clear guidelines, and then be able to help the students because they have a distinct idea of what they are looking for. Summer projects should be teacherdesigned to insure the relevancy of the project, guarantee structured guidelines, and limit the unnecessary stress for students.\n",

      "Error processing text: To the State Senate, Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popularbased vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fulfilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors 3. This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. The Electoral College is a process, not a place Office of the Federal Register, 1. This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well. According to Plumer, Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote 2. This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters 2. This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states... 2. This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winnertakeall system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. It's official The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational Plumer,2. This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed. Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid RunOff Elections... Posner, 3. These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winnertakesall method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution... 3. In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Runoff Elections, Posner states that, The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast 3. I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking. In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swingstates are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America.\n",

      "Error processing text: Is online school truly a good tool for learning? With the newer technology we have today, some schools are taking advantage of this and offering computer based classes. While some might think this is a good idea, there are several reasons why this does not truly benefit students because, it would ultamantly unprepare them for later in life. Firstly, It is important that children learn responsibility young so they are prepared for adulthood. Another idea is with online school it makes it very easy for these students to cheat on graded work. Finally, with online school, Students can become too dependent on technology. Firstly, Children need to know responsibility to have a successful future. The way we can truly prepare children to be successful is to install a responsible mindset. One good way to get them there, is to let them get themselves ready in the morning for school everyday. A child who has online school would not have to do the same necessities as a child who has to go out everyday would. The student who attends online learning would not have to get dressed everyday or even brush their teeth! While the student who attends the Brick and Mortar school would have to get dressed, make sure they practice good hygiene everyday, and even pack their own lunches and book bags before leaving in the mornings. Children who attend online school miss out on this crucial part of learning how to take care and be responsible for themselves. Next, students could easily cheat if they have classes online. Those who do classes online are most likely not being supervised. If they are not being supervised during a test, what is stopping them from looking up answers on their phones with Google, taking photos of the lesson to use, or even notes on tests! Some might answer this with Their parents are home with them, they aren't left unsupervised.. But Most people today work a nine to five job everyday and don't have time to watch their child take a test. For example, I have a class online at my school. Everything is on the website provided by the school, So Students often cheat on their quizzes and tests in that class. But, because is it entirely online, there is no way the teacher would know they are cheating if they finish a lesson at home. But, when it happens at the school or even in my other classes the teachers easily know if someone is cheating on an assignment. In return, Kids who cheat don't get the full reward of actually learning. Lastly. Students who do online schooling will eventually depend on technology too much. While their classes are taught with an actual teacher through video chat, they will not stay that way forever. Some courses are already completely internet based the lesson, quiz and even test are all on the website. It is important that children know how to do things for themselves. If their lesson is there, wouldn't key points be emphasized? How will they know what is important to get from a lecture? If students attend an online school, it just adds to the list of things that we rely on technology for. Children need to know how to do things for themselves and not have the internet to do them for them. For example, Amazons' Alexa, she can do just about everything from turning the TV on, to shop, or even turn the Microwave on for you. If we rely on technology and add schooling to the list, we are depriving our children to do basic things. On the other hand, some may argue that online schooling helps Students who are on home bound. Kids often get hurt from participating in sports or just playing outside. This results in them going on home bound from school. Children who are on home bound can benefit from online school by staying afloat in their classes and also keeping in the seven to three schedule of learning. But, Kids need social interaction. Social Interaction is a vital part of development. If students have school over the computer or video chatting, they are not getting the proper interaction they need. Yes, they would still see their parents everyday. But, Kids need to mingle with people their age. Just like an adult does not want to be with a five year old all day, dose not mean that a five year old wants to be with a forty year old all day. We can't let children live online through their early years and throw them into the workforce later,They will not be able to act right in public! If you look at children who are home schooled their whole lives, they do not act the same as a child who went to public or private school. The students who learn from home do not get the fight or flight mentality as a student who has witnessed fights or lock downs at school during in their life. You can't shelter a child from the world by giving them online school. They will not be able to survive. Therefore, Students do not benefit from online school. While home bound students have the ability to prosper with the idea. It is important that every student learns responsibility to get themselves ready for the day in the morning, not being too dependent on technology, and also not to cheat on assignments so they can fully learn. But, most importantly, Children need the crucial social interaction that is vital to healthy living. Without these factors, a Child would be unprepared to be a successful adult.\n",

      "Error processing text: your principle is making everyone join a school related clubsport. But your a really shy person, so you asked if you had to join. your principle said you will have to choose at least one activity. Lets make a character named Generic_Name, he loves to play sports and play the guitar so he is glad that they made this rule. But Generic_Name on the other hand, doesn't play an instrument or play sports, she likes to read and she is a really good artist. so she tries to find a club that has to do with learning or something to do with art. initially Generic_Name and his friend group all went to the baseball club and met the couch and instantly started practicing. Generic_Name couldn't find any of her interest in that area. so she goes to the library and finds that there are all these book clubs. she got super excited. she went up to one of the tables and asked what kind of books. a girl she new from math class said all the books here are non fiction. Generic_Name asked do you know where i could find the graphic novel area. she pointed in the back corner, where the lights are dim and the walls are all starched up. Generic_Name said thank you, she went to the back corner. she said nervously hello is anyone back here, suddenly a guy dressed like a zombie jumps out and scares Generic_Name. she screams and runs away. the zombie guy turned around and said to his friend excitedly man that was the closes i have ever been to a girl, HIGH FIVE. Generic_Name started thinking what other things she's good at. she thought about it and started walking towards the art room. she walks in and the Mr Generic_Name the art teacher pops out and says welcome to the art room how may i help you. Generic_Name asked what kind of art clubs are in here. Mr Generic_Name said well there's painting club where you paint anything that comes to mind Generic_Name shook her head no and asked is there other types of clubs. Mr Generic_Name said there's water coloring club, computer arts, drawing club, and there's animation club. Generic_Name asked may you lead me to the drawing table. Mr Generic_Name says follow me. she looks at the amount of people around the drawing table. she starts to get nervous. Generic_Name starts thinking of her social anxiety and her eyes start to twitch and she starts messing with her hair. she walks up to the table and puts her name down as Generic_Name. Mr Generic_Name says great choice your going to love this club. she says thank you as he walks away. the next day, Generic_Name walks into the art classroom finding that they are drawing animals. she starts looking around to see if she knows anyone. she doesn't recognize anyone so she goes into the back corner and starts to draw a really cool looking dragon. A person named Generic_Name comes up to her and says Hi, my name is Generic_Name. she looks up and says Hi, my name is Generic_Name. Generic_Name asked about what she is drawing, Generic_Name says I'm drawing a alligator, what about you Generic_Name replies and says a dragon. Generic_Name nods and asked what's are you going to name the drawing? Generic_Name shrugs and replies I don't know what about you, what are you going to name your drawing Generic_Name says that question i can not answer at the moment. Generic_Name turns around and starts moving back to her desk. Generic_Name said Generic_Name would you like to come over to my house after school tomorrow. Generic_Name turns around and says yeah that would be nice. as the school day goes on, Generic_Name can't wait to have a friend over at her house. Generic_Name heard the bell and starts racing to her car. she starts the car and starts going home. a couple minutes later Generic_Name shows up to her house. Generic_Name knocks and Generic_Name invites her in. Generic_Name and Generic_Name walk up stairs to Generic_Name's room. And Generic_Name pulls out paper and pencils for them to start drawing. Generic_Name grabs the pencil and paper and starts to draw a platypus. Generic_Name looks up and says what are you going to draw and Generic_Name says a dragon. Generic_Name has really bad social anxeity. she would start to figit and her eyes would start to twitch a little. but this is a great example of how to get over your own anxeity and take a step forward in life, not be all by youself your whole life. most likely after this she would be able to make new friends and go out to restruants, amusment parks, and bowling alleys. Generic_Name joining the drawing club was one of the best things that happened to her. and that is why I agree with what her princible has done to his school.\n",

      "Error processing text: There are schools that offer distance learning for students so that they can work in their homes on computers. Online learning can be beneficial to the student for health reasons or personal reasons however, sometimes distance learning is not as beneficial as the classroom experience. There are many aspects of a physical classroom that online students will miss out on. Online classes can be simple for the student, but the simplicity of online learning is not enough for the education of the student. Even though online classes can make students feel comfortable with working on their own time, classroom instruction is more beneficial to students than online classes because it helps students gain social experience with their peers, helps students communicate easily with their teachers, and helps students remember lesson material better with physical experience. Online learning can be beneficial to the student when it comes to students' individual schedules. There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student. However, the social experience between a student and his peers in the classroom can help the student grow as an individual with good social skills. In the classroom, there must be some communication between the students. For instance, communication among the students is present when the teacher assigns group work. In group projects, such as PowerPoint presentations, Google Slides presentations, dioramas, posters, and videos, students need to work together to complete the assignment. Through this experience, students can create good communication skills with each other and make friends comfortably. This characteristic of the physical classroom cannot be found in a digital classroom. In a digital classroom, students do not see other peers in person, making communication harder. Also, students do not know what is happening behind the screen with other students. Students may mistakenly distort communication with each other, eventually ruining peer relationships. Learning social skills from the classroom will help students' social skills in the outside world, so it is important that students take the physical route to classroom learning rather than online learning. Student communication with the teacher becomes easier when the student is in a classroom rather than in an online class. In a physical classroom, the teacher is usually present and is easily accessible, but in an online class, the teacher is not always there when a student needs them the student would have to rely on sending an email or sending a message through a schoolsponsored online chat and wait for a response. The waiting time can range from seconds to hours, or perhaps, days, depending on the teacher's schedule. For example, in the summer, a student may take an online class for economics and personal finance. There would be a time where the student would need to ask a proctor a question about the testing rules, so in that situation, he would email and wait for a response before the test date. However, the student received an email regarding testing rules after the test date. In situations like this, there is uncertainty in determining when the proctor will respond since the student does not know exactly when the proctor is online but, in a classroom, this scenario would not happen. Because the student is face to face with the teacher, he gets an immediate response. This makes the situation much easier and stress free for the student. Physical experience can help students learn better in a class than on a computer. Online, the student is limited to a screen with lesson materials on it. Also, schools and teachers are limited to adding documents, websites, and tests online. Because of these limits, the online experience feels dull and straightforward with tests and documents. In a physical classroom, there are lectures, models, posters, and handson activities available to the student. These physical resources can help a student remember class materials better through the unique experience they would go through. Unlike the online learning experience, a physical learning experience is flexible and fun to the student. A computer will fail to produce these resources to the students because of its limited functionality from technology. Classroom taught classes are more beneficial to students rather than online classes because of the social skills students attain, the simple communication the students have with teachers, and the memorable physical experience the students gain. These significant differences in physcial classrooms and online classrooms should be taken into consideration by many schools when deciding whether or not they should offer online classes. Technology should not be overused by schools in the age of modern technology otherwise, modern students will lose the social skills and educational benefits a classroom would have brought. Classroombased classes will benefit the future of students.\n",

      "Error processing text: As Generic_Name gently strokes her scrawny cat, she ponders back to the day she lost herself. It was 8th grade year, this was the year your life started. Before you could even figure out yourself, just your grades alone could determine if you got into college or not. Although she already had alright grades, she still spend countless hours studying instead of taking care of her acne or just getting in the shower. Soon she began to realize that her life was becoming numb, she stopped answering texts, talking, and she even began to loose her friends. Before she knew it, she was spending every weekend alone in her room just studying for absolutely no reason. Not long after, her parents became worried and sent her to a therapist, but most of the time she just came up with an excuse not to go. Generic_Name mainly made excuses because she thought nobody could give her advice that would relate to her life. This just shows that if you ask multiple people for advice you are bound to find someone that can relate to you. Seeking advice from more that one person you trust can be beneficial because you can hear different perspectives and make your own choice, you can also learn from their mistakes, and you can become a better person by listening to what other people have to say. First off, making your own opinion, after hearing other advice, is important because it allows you to feel like you are making your own decisions in life. Similarly, when Generic_Name was a teen, her mother told her, Even though people will always try to tear you down, never take their words to heart. Now Generic_Name is a motivational speaker and shares her stories to everyone. This just shows that one little sentence can truly change someones life. For instance, Generic_Name goes to school everyday knowing she will get bullied, but she just remember the words her grandpa said, Although they are the ones being mean to you, remember that they are probably going through a lot more things than you are. Just this small piece of advice that Generic_Name hangs onto makes her feel like she is changing lives everyday. Secondly, learning from the mistakes that other people made can help you so you won't make the same mistake. For example, Generic_Name learned from his uncle, If you want to own and thrive in the pizza business you have to make profit, and now Generic_Name is the owner of the biggest pizza place in New York! Saying this, normally you can't become famous or rich without a little help and and advice from other people. Additionally, Lady Gaga says that the only thing that got her through middle school and high school was the last words her mom said, I promise the times you feel like nothing is going right in you life, those days will make you a better person. Lady Gaga needed that quote a lot of her life and she knew that her mom didn't have that when she needed it. Although life isn't easy, the things that help you will probaly hepl other people too, even if they seem little. Finally, just listening to other people say and taking it to heart will make you a better person one day. For instance, Generic_Name who was very shy as a kid was always told by his mom, Express yourself in whatever way you can, once Generic_Name took that to heart he began writing poems and songs. Generic_Name is now 21 and professionally writes songs for popular artists. If Generic_Name had stayed how he was, he would probably be working in a normal office and living in a small apartment with very noisy neighbors. Another example is Generic_Name, she is a professional model, but when she was younger she had no coordination and it seemed like she had two left feet. Until one day, her mom suggested that she should take ballet to help with her coordination. Even after just a couple lessons, she was already doing better. Just the small act of kindness that her mom showed to her made her and her life so much better. As Generic_Name trudges through the door, she ignores everybody in her path and heads straight to her room. Generic_Name hadn't realized how difficult it is to move schools, until is actually happened to her. Everything was different and she didn't know anybody, neither had she met anybody yet. With a soft tap on the door, her sister Generic_Name enters the room and says, Hey sis I'm guessing the first day was rough? With a sad nod, Generic_Name turns and questioned, How do you do it? Everybody is so different from my old school and nobody wants to talk to me. Generic_Name sits right next to her and pulls her into a hug. Not long after, she says, Just be open to new people and don't worry about what is to come, live in the moment. After a good night's sleep and the advice Generic_Name told her, she starts her day off by introducing herself to everyone she meets. Before the day is over, she already has a table to sit and and a large group of friends. When Generic_Name comes through the door, she sprints to Generic_Name and gives her a huge hug and exclaims, It worked! I introduced myself to everyone I saw and now I have a table to sit at, and lots of friends! Generic_Name stands up and squeals with joy. Without Generic_Name's advice Generic_Name would have never found the friends she has now. Seeking advice from more that one person you trust can be beneficial because you can hear different perspectives and make your own choice, you can also learn from their mistakes, and you can become a better person by listening to what other people have to say.\n",

      "Error processing text: I have been attending public school for my entire life. There have been highs and lows throughout that time, and sometimes I wished that I could have taken school from behind a screen in the comfort of my own home. But once I start thinking about all the good things that have come from the public school environment I realize that I wouldn't have it any other way. I've met my best friends at school, had many laughs, and most of all, learned valuable lessons that will help me for the rest of my life. You can't get anywhere close to the same experience of school through a screen. Distance learning would not be beneficial to students because it doesn't allow them to learn social skills, teamwork, and would limit the activities teachers could have them do. I have only met a few home schooled kids in my life, but I'm not the only one who has had the same experience. My most recent encounter with one of them was when me and a friend were taking driving lessons in order to get our licenses. We had to get some other kid before we started however, and we asked our instructor what school he was from. He said that the kid was home schooled. We didn't think much of it until he got into the car. He looked totally normal, but when me and my friend greeted him he said nothing and quickly jerked his head to stare straight at the floor. It was very obvious he was uncomfortable around us and it began to make us think why. Pretty quickly we came to the conclusions it was because he was home schooled and lacked normal social skills, so he didn't know how to act around us. This is a perfect example on why distance learning would not be beneficial. Almost every job in the world and college you have to interact with people. School teaches us how to do that every day. We learn how to hold conversations, how to politely talk to adults, how to deal with conflicts, make friends, and many other important skills. You might be thinking that the student could still talk to other kids and adults through the screen, but they would only be present during class time which is when students are most independent and talking is at a minimal. Its the times during lunch, between classes or other free time when these skills are most developed. From my first year of school I can still remember one of the first lessons we learned about Teamwork. Every single one of my classes has always conducted multiple exercises every week to help learn team work. Whether it was doing labs together in science, working on a project in math, or being on the same team in P.E., the teachers strongly believed that teamwork is one of the most important skills someone can learn, and I one hundred percent agree. Learning to work with other people efficiently has countless benefits. There are some tasks that simply cannot be done without a team of people working together. Kids need to learn how to divide up work evenly to create efficiency and communicate Ideas. distance leaning simply doesn't allow for activities like that. Its just you in your own space not sharing the same resources as everyone else. You just wouldn't get the same benefit from distance learning, and In the real world most jobs just simply are not like that. Some of the most exciting days of school are when teachers have us do something different other than reading, writing, worksheets, or other tasks most people think about when they think about school. Almost all teachers know that doing these same repetitive tasks everyday will just cause students to lose energy and interest, so often times they'll think of new activities or projects to do that often times feel like games. For example one of my favorite games is, trashketball. The class gets split into teams and each team member takes turns answering different questions. If they get the question correct they get to attempt to shoot a basketball, normally made of crumbled paper taped together, and shoot it into the hoop, which is normally an empty trashcan. If they make it in, the team gets a point. This is one my favorite things to play in school that still maintains educational value. Teachers also use games like this to incentivise good behavior in the classroom, or good grades. There are many other types of alternate hands on activities like this that many other teachers use especially in classes like science. Many times these alternate lessons help us hold on to information better than if we were to just take notes off a PowerPoint or something traditional like that, and is one of the main advantages of public schooling. Sitting behind the computer limits the amount of alternative activities that the teacher can give because the student not physically being there doesn't allow them to participate as intended for activities like this. Obviously there are benefits to distance leaning and there could be some kids who might suffer from a disease where distance leaning would be their answer, but if the option is there to go to normal school, the benefits outweigh the negatives too much to validate distance learning. Its only through traditional school in a class room with other kids that kids get to develop basic social skills and team working abilities, and it gives the teachers many more options for new innovative way to teach the kids. It just would not be nearly as beneficial for a kid to opt out of regular school for distance leaning.\n",

      "Error processing text: Summer projects are a painful, but necessary experience that many students have to face as they continue their academic careers in middle and high school. Teachers understand that without these projects, students could lose much of their academic progress that they have made throughout the year, and so these projects become necessary evils that make Summer slightly less enjoyable. However, while these projects are often necessary, there is some debate as to how they should be executed. Some argue for a studentbased project experience, while others say that teachers should be the ones in charge of these assignments. However, the latter option would be easier for everyone and more effective, providing an organized project environment that would hold students accountable for their work. With teacherbased Summer projects, both students and teachers would suffer less stress and be able to more easily complete their tasks. For students, having specific instructions on what to do for a project removes one of the hardest obstacles that studentbased projects would make them face actually designing a project from start to finish. When students have instructions, they already know what to do, and they avoid the stress of having to figure it out on their own. Summer projects should be as stress free as possible for students, and to achieve this goal, the teacherbased project is preferable. In addition, the teacherbased project would put less stress on the teacher. With a studentbased project, the teacher would have a difficult experience while trying to grade each of the projects, because the parameters and expectations of the project would be less specific. Thus, the teacher would not be able to objectively assess the quality of the work that the students are actually doing, and they would have to take an individual approach to each project. With a teacherbased project, the teacher gives the students specific instructions, making grades easier to give because the teacher can assess each project with the same expectations and objectively give each student the grade they deserve. Teacherbased projects make the lives of both students and teachers easier, and they should be utilized in order to make Summer and the start of the school year less stressful. In addition, the teacherbased approach makes the start of the school year organized, with all students having learned or reviewed the same topics over their summer. For example, when a teacher wants students to review mathematics over the summer, they should provide a worksheet of review questions for students to complete. With this type of project, students all review the same exact questions, putting themselves all in similar places academically when the school year starts. If that same teacher tells their students to simply complete some mathematics questions over the summer, without giving them specific questions, students will all review different topics some will review the more advanced topics, and some will review less advanced ones. When the school year rolls around, the students will all be in different places. This would make things harder for both the teacher and student. The teacher would have to review all of the topics in detail because otherwise, they would be leaving some students behind. With a teacherbased project, the teacher has the ability to make sure that all students are on the same level at the start of the school year. This makes the start of the year much more organized and puts students in a strong position to continue learning without being hindered by the different levels of review done by their peers. However, some may say that the studentbased project is beneficial because it gives students the opportunity to learn about topics that actually interest them. While this is one of the biggest arguments for the studentbased project, it is based on faulty logic. If a student is genuinely interested in a topic, then they will learn about it without being prompted. Studentbased projects ask students to come up with a topic that they are interested in, but they limit that topic to a certain subject barrier, such as English, Mathematics, Science, or History. Many students are not interested by anything that is limited to these subjects. Thus, this idea that studentbased projects inspire a greater creativity and trigger a passion for learning is flawed. Some students may end up finding something that they are truly interested in, but many others are left struggling to come up with a topic and doing the bare minimum to complete a project based on that topic. Furthermore, students are more easily held accountable for their work with teacherbased projects. If every student has to complete the same steps, then they will have a greater tendency to actually do the work. There are no loopholes, and all students will have to do the same amount of work. This lessens the workload for those who naturally overachieve, and holds the rest of students accountable for their work. Overall, it makes things equal for students, setting a good precedent for all students to work hard and achieve what they need to be successful. The teacherbased project is beneficial for both students and teachers in many ways, and it is vastly superior to the studentbased project. It leaves all students with an equal review of their subjects, and makes teachers able to start the school year without having to worry about differences in the academic knowledge of their students. This type of summer project should be the most implimented in order to give students and teachers a good environment for success at the start of the school year.\n",

      "Error processing text: Generic_Name is having a test tomorrow and needs to get an one hundred percent so she can pass math class but she is having a extremely hard time understanding what ten plus ten is, she asks her dad the question, he says, Im not the best math teacher but i'm pretty sure ten plus ten is twenty one. Generic_Name believes her dad, and reminds herself ten plus ten is twenty one. the next morning she wakes up and reminds herself to plus ten is twenty one and goes to school, she has math right as she goes to school, she took the test and it said she got a eighty nine percent. She was shocked and didnt know what to do, she looked at the one she got wrong and it was ten plus ten, she was even more surprised and told the teacher. The teacher said, The answer was twenty. She failed math class all because of her dad making a silly mistake and because Generic_Name did not ask anyone else. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see if it is truly the right answer, in case the first person that looked at it did it wrong, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at. First off, you can see if it is truly the right answer. For example, Generic_Name has science homework on fission and fusion and needs help, he tries the problem himself and thinks he did it right and goes on his day. the next day he turns it in feeling confident about his work, the teacher grades the homework and gives back the papers, Generic_Name knows that he got an A but instead he got an F because he didnt ask anyone to help him and he has to pay the price. Generic_Name has science homework on fission and fusion and needs help, he tries the problem himself and then asks his parents they star the ones Generic_Name got wrong so that he can fix his mistakes. Now that Generic_Name double checked his work he earned an A. Additionally, Generic_Name has a orchestra concert and doesnt understand a note on his piece, he acts like he knows it and goes on. The teacher said, anyone need assistance, and no one answered. The orchestra was in the middle of the piece and the note was getting closer and closer to Generic_Name. The note hit and Generic_Name let out a loud shriek on his instrument and everyone looked at him like he was crazy, the judges marked down our score and we got a three one of the worst grades in orchestra. Generic_Name has a orchestra concert today and is having a hard time understanding one note in the piece, he asks the teacher, What note is that on measure thirty two. The teacher says D. Now they had a great concert and they got a one, the best score you can get. Secondly, in case the first person you asked got it wrong. For instance, Generic_Name has a lab in science and is working with elephant toothpaste, he wants it to explode just like in the movies. Generic_Name did all the instructions and his partner double checked we were good to go. Then we let it go and nothing happened, we were both looking at each other confused. The teacher looked at what we did wrong and we didnt put the acid in the tube. Generic_Name is in lab today, they are trying to make elephant toothpaste. Generic_Name looked at all the instructions and his partner double checked, we raised our hand to tell the teacher that we are ready and the teacher checked the lab and they forgot the acid. Now that they have the acid they can see the big, foamy explosion. Another example, Generic_Name has soccer practice and needs to know the play that the coach is going pick, the coach wasnt paying attention and said, Oh um lets do route five. Generic_Name agrees and starts the play, he goes up the field passes to the player up top he passes back down and Generic_Name kicks it. The play is simple but the defense didnt here them so they started without the defense paying attention. Generic_Name kicks it and hits the goalie in the face and the goalie was stunned because he didnt see it and fell. If the coach was paying more attention then it wouldnt have happened. Generic_Name is at soccer practice and coach was not paying any attention and Generic_Name asks what play coach said, Lets do route five. Generic_Name nodes his head and goes on. The assistant coach says hold up, the defense isnt even ready. The assistant coach tells the defense the play. No one has to get injured. Lastly, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at. For example, Generic_Name has a science fair that is due today and he dosen't comprehend one of the slides he is scared that he wont make the finals, but he turns it in anyways and the judges are looking at Generic_Name's science fair project. They are on the part where Generic_Name was worried on, they scoped it out very strictly and gave Generic_Name a score. He got second place all because of that one slide. Generic_Name has a science fair due today and he has one problem, he has a question on what to do on this slide. The other groups were nice enough to help Generic_Name out and get him first place. Adding on, Generic_Name was a straight A student and did not want to lose her streak. Generic_Name has a very important essay to do for a grade. It is worth sixty percent of her grade, she does not want to get a bad grade on the essay because then her grade will turn into a C. She has a question but dosent want the other people to know that she isnt smart so she keeps it in. On the essay she is nervous and is confused but she turns it in anyways, she regrets not telling anyone about her question. She got a B on it and now she is not a straight A student. Generic_Name has an essay due today and has a question she asks a lot of her class mates the question and they told her, Now Generic_Name is ready and prepared for the essay. Generic_Name is having a test tomorrow and has a question, she asks her dad what is ten plus ten is he says twenty one Generic_Name believes him but still asks her mom, she said it was twenty. Now that I know the answer I can get an A and pass math class. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see if it is truly the right answer, in case the first person that looked at it did it wrong, you can get a better understanding of what your looking at.\n",

      "Error processing text: Today, in the actuality, a lot of people have a big dreams that we can to complete have a better life for our future family or also to own self but a many people be surrender becuase most of the time have the fuilures, when they are doing something I think that our life without the fuilures will be bored and easy becuase we don't have the energies to work hard or fight for our goals or dreams. I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you can help other to complete their dreams or their goals, also you can have more spirit and a positives attitudes than you have in the begging, also you can be a successful and strong person. You can help others to complete with their dreams or their goals, because sometimes a lot of people who want to comply their dreams or goals they don't have the motivation of their families or the economy necessary to buy all the studies or all the things that they need, so when you finish all the goals that you make you, you can assist to others. I know an experience of child from Mexico, his name was Generic_Name. Generic_Name was a child with the low economy resources, I remember that he toll us all the things that he was comply to get a better life for his family and him self. So one day, Generic_Name received a big notice from a presidency of Generic_City, the place were we live, that he can have a opportunity to study whatever he want. He and his family were happy for the big opportunity that Generic_Name have. At pass of the years, when Generic_Name finished study the collage, I know that Generic_Name is a big entrepreneur from a big company that he created after finished the college. Today, also Generic_Name likes help other people who want to be a successful in their life like the presidency help him. In my observation to be a good person likes Generic_Name makes that you have a lot of open opportunities to get the success or the things that Generic_Name every day was dreamed. Also you can be a successful and strong person because all people knows that the life is not easy and less if you want to do something hard or something that you need put a lot of time in it to pursuit of success and if you think that your goals or dreams are difficult to complete. Sometimes we need strive more that the people or your mind think. Another of my experiences is when was in Mexico, I was little girl, I remember that most of my days I talked with my family, my mother, my father and also sometimes with my grandfathers about that I want study the High School in Untied States because I saw a TV Shows and movies shows all the schools and also my father lived a lot of years in this country so, he talk me about the schools, the teachers, the classmates, the classes and classrooms that were to different form my country, the lunch time and I think that the thing that was more exercise was with the lockers because in my country don't have lockers or something to put our things likes books, pencils, notebooks and sometimes, the food. At the time that was grow up, I was continue with the same mentality to come to this country to comply my studies. I remember that have a lot of failures in the time to the arrival to United States but,even if never let that my thoughts or the commentaries of the negative people will be fell bad about my big dream. I think that was a strong person because is hard to come to other place with different culture and customers in everything and also is hard and sad separate to the persons who love. Other might say that the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success does not matter or they are disagree because you can lose your forces to continue and accomplish your goals and sometimes this failure can make us fell sad. However, you can have more spirit and positives attitudes than you have in the begging because when you have a failure in something that you study a lot or put your all time in it, you can have the mentality that you can to do well it, just you need strive a little be more that you make before. This is one of my experiences in my life the last week, in my History class with Generic_Name, we have a quiz form the first unit so, we did the quiz, but the majority of my classmates and me, we don't pass the quiz, my teacher talked with us to give us a another opportunity to pass it. A lot of my classmates tell her that they do not were think that they can pass it even though they study a lot before the retake but, I have the spirit and the positives attitudes that I can passed the quiz with a good grade and study well at home. I think that my experience, it is good example because a lot of people who want to complete their dreams does not matter the times that they need to try to get a good result and a good recompense for the effort that they make. In my opinion, I think that Churchill's statement success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm it is important and I agree with it because you can motive other people to be a good person with good feelings and goals, another reason is because you can to be a successful and respectful person and you can have a good attitudes through haved a bad results, every time you need stay be happy. Most of the people we have the big goals to comply something that always we dreaming.\n",

      "Error processing text: Imagine, one day you're at school, and you hear over the loudspeaker that all students in the building must report immediately to the Lecture Hall, for some new adjustments. Although you are a bit surprised by this sudden announcement, you walk towards the Lecture Hall at a leisurely pace as if you were anticipating something like this to happen. Once you're there, you sit in a chair and wait for all the other students to come rushing in like a stampede of wildebeests. After everything settles down, the principal picks up a mic from a lectern on the stage and starts a speech. In this speech, he talks about how the after school clubs are experiencing a steep decline in the number of students that attend them. He presents the crowd with a solution to this problem, a solution that is greeted with some harsh criticism from the majority of the student body. He says that, in order to keep the after school program alive, all students will be forced to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and that all students who chose to not follow this new rule will be expelled. Bewildered by this, you yell out in protest of this new policy, but to no avail. For the principal has already left the stage, and now you have to be a part of one of those worthless, unnecessary, and boring after school clubs. As you can see, it is detrimental, to both the students and the school as a whole, to force all of the students in a school into participation in an after school activity. Due to a plethora of factors along with the one I just described, I wholeheartedly disagree with my principal on forcing every student in the school to attend an after school club. If you don't believe me alreadyin regards with this issue at my school, then hopefully the following paragraphs will succeed in persuading you. First of all, making it mandatory for all students in a school to attend at least one club takes away some of their freedom with how they experience their lives. By this, I mean that, by forcing students to go to an after school club, you are limiting their options for what they can do after school is over. This is due to the simple fact that, once the student chooses their clubs, the time that that club occupies can't really be used for anything else and takes up a big chunk of the student's schedule. To give context, allow me to give you an example. Lets say that Generic_Name, a seventh grader, decided to take Quiz Bowl as his extracurricular activity. Immediately all regular activities from 230 530 are canceled. In addition to this, he now has to go to some weekend meetings, resulting in him not have time to hang out with his friends anymore, study for school, do all of his homework, or go to the gym. Instead, he now has to guess answers to random questions about the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and wait till about 600 PM to get picked up by his bus, and then dropped off at home at almost 700 PM, completely exhausted and burned out. As, you can hopefully see, having to do even just one after school activity can take a lot time out of a students life, and in extension a lot of freedom with their life. Second of all, with this new policy, transportation can become an incredibly detrimental issue for students that suddenly have to take at least one extracurricular activity. This is because there will always be some students in a school who can't take the bus and have parents that work too far away to be able to pick them up, making it nearly impossible for those students to get home safely, or on time. In addition to this, transportation can be a huge issue in the fact that, with ALL students having to take an after school activity, on any given day, buses could have to leave behind some students because of a shortage of seats, leaving those who were left behind with no options to get back home. For example, let's say that all the students decide to participate in an extracurricular activity on the same day. With all of those students, it would be near impossible for them all to get a bus ride home. And because of all the parents that have to work during the time that those students would get picked up, the school would be left with a large crowd of students that have no way of getting home on time. Finally, this policy will probably create a harmful school environment. By this, I mean that it would result in a multitude of considerably hardtodealwith problems. Such problems would be an unmotivated student body, protesting from parents, and an unproductive student body. The lower school morale may stem from anger in students at the principal, and teachers that are exhausted from being overworked due to the fact that most of them will have to host at least one after school club the parents might complain due to the fact that they won't be able to interact with their children as much, and because they might not like the discontent in their children and unproductivity would be caused by students burning out from the extra time that they have to spend in school. In addition to all of these problems, students might also try to not participate in extracurricular activities resulting in extreme punishmentsi. e expulsion. To wrap it all up, there are a lot of reasons as to why my principal's new policy on extracurricular activities isn't very great. It limits a students freedom, it can't really function due to the lack of transportation that is needed for all of the students, and it creates a bad school environment. For these reasons, I think that the principal shouldn't have made this policy.\n",

      "Error processing text: Imagine it was a hot summer day and a student is at home complaining to their parents that they want to hang out with their friends. Instead, their parents refused and they had to stay home to do their summer project that was assigned by their teacher. This will result in the student becoming really stressed and sad because they won't be able to spend time with their friends during their summer break. Summer projects should be studentdesigned because students can choose what projects they are interested in, they will be able to retain the information more easily, and they will be able to have fun with their friends while doing these projects. Summer projects should be studentdesigned because students can choose what projects they are interested in. My friend Generic_Name, who is a high school student, wants to becoming a pharmacist when she gets older. She has been telling me that she really wants to volunteer at a pharmacy for her summer project. This is because she is interested in helping others, while still learning about the health science aspect of medicines. This shows that Generic_Name is spending her summer wisely by choosing what she is interested in doing, and learning the information while at the pharmacy. It is important for Generic_Name to choose what she wants to do with her time during the summer since it could be beneficial for her. This is because she would rather learn useful information that will help guide her career path in the future, instead of making a poster about chemistry vocab terms that was assigned by her teacher, since she would probably be bored and not enjoy it. Furthermore my cousin Generic_Name, who is a junior in high school, wanted to make a sculpture that could be displayed at her school for her AP art class. She feels that choosing to make this art project could help her learn about the major concepts of building sculptures. This shows that Generic_Name is spending time in the summer doing what she loves to do, while still learning relevant information at the same time. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacherdesigned because some students might be indecisive when choosing what they are interested in and want to do for their summer project. However, summer projects should be studentdesigned because even if they are indecisive, they will eventually choose a project that would definitely help them in the future and will enjoy doing as well. Furthermore, summer projects should be studentdesigned because students will be able to retain the information more easily. My friend Generic_Name, wants to become a math teacher when she gets older because she loves being around kids, and doing fun math problems. During the summer, Generic_Name wants to volunteer as a math tutor for elementary school kids, and create a poster on what she learned from this experience for her summer project. This shows that she is choosing to do something she is really passionate for, so Generic_Name will most likely be happy to do this project and will retain the information easily. It is important for students to be able to retain information while doing something beneficial, like a project, because they could learn more things that they haven't learned before when they choose their own ideas for their project. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacherdesigned because teachers will organize these assignments in a certain way for students to understand and memorize the information more easily. However, summer projects should be studentdesigned because if students enjoy what they are doing and learning over the summer, they are most likely to retain that information. This is because they tend to be more interested about the information they choose to learn, instead of a teacher assigning students to do a research paper of a famous math person for their project. Lastly, summer projects should be studentdesigned because students will be able to have fun with their friends while doing these projects. My friends and I are interested in volunteering to become Chinese tutors for kids. We love the the language and helping younger kids, in order for these kids to expand their knowledge in Chinese. We decided it would be fun for all of us to do this summer project together, because it would be enjoyable for us and be a good learning experience. If we volunteer to become Chinese tutors, it shows that we are demonstrating our Chinese knowledge in the writing and speaking areas to these kids. It is important that we have fun in the summer, while still learning information that could be useful in our futures. This is because we only get a limited amount of time to spend time with friends and have a break from school. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacherdesigned because they like when students work on projects by themselves, since students tend to be distracted if they work with friends. However, summer projects should be studentdesigned because students tend to like spending summers with friends, since during school they have less time to hang out. As a result if they get to choose their project, they will be able to have a chance to work with friends while continuing to learn in the summer. Ultimately, summer projects should indeed be studentdesigned. After all, students can choose what projects they are interested in, they will be able to retain the information more easily, and students will be able to have fun with their friends while doing these projects. Many students should take action and let everyone know why it's best for students to be able to choose what they want to do during the summer, in order to continue learning, enjoy their summer, and benefit them in the future. Do teachers really understand the stress and anxiety they put on these students during summer from these projects they choose that will most likely not even help them?\n",

I don't think I could ever imagine that because I believe that seeking multiple opinions for advice can best help a person to make the best choice. When I get multiple opinions I can get a different point of view on my choices, I can make sure the choice I am making is the best choice by learning from other people, and it makes me more open minded to things I haven't tired before. I do think that you also shouldn't just get your opinion from anyone, especially in today's society with social media, but I do think that having multiple opinions to come back to is truly important. When I get multiple opinions for advice I can get a different outlook and perspective of my own opinion at hand. I think that if I only asked the same person for advice I would become small minded and my actions would reflect that. My choices would always be influenced by that person and I would lack understanding of others. It also makes me realize things I never knew. For example, when I was doing course selections for high school this year I did not know what science class to take. The county and my science teacher do not support taking biology in freshman year I, however, asked a friend of mine in high school what it was like since she was taking the class freshman year. She told me that it was not impossible, but just a lot of work you need to be committed to do. I am glad that I got another opinion from her because It helps me to realize that it isn't an impossible course to take which my teacher made me believe. I think getting different advice also gives you a diverse point of view of people and their lives. Another example I have is about my grandma. My grandparents grew up during a war and have different opinions on things than others. One thing my grandma hates to do is waste food. Always growing up I knew that I shouldn't waste food and if I was ever getting rid of old food, I should do it when grandma's not home. While at school though I notice that there are people who waste food and it's normal for them. The different opinions of people affect their values and lifestyle and I think it is important to understand them. Getting multiple opinions can help you to verify your choice is the best one. When I'm making a difficult choice I usually seek advice from those close to me. For example, when I was deciding whether or not to apply to TJ my mom's opinion was absolutely yes. I felt that this was my only choice until I told my grandma. My grandma told me that when my mom had went to TJ she had constantly been stressed. My grandma said that she did not want to push me to go to TJ and only go If I wanted to. Having more than my mom's advice was useful when I did end up deciding to apply because it made me aware of the choice I was making. When you get multiple opinions it bring up things you may have overlooked. When a doctor has a patient who has an issue that they are not sure what it is or the best way to treat them, they'll get a second opinion. Getting a second opinion from another doctor can help get the patient the best treatment for their particular situation or condition. One person alone could look over minor details that another person would not. My last point is that you may find the answer you were truly looking for. When my mom was looking into getting new floors, she did not just get one opinion. She went around and got different advice on the type of wood, style and color. She got multiple opinions until she got the choice that she truly loved and was happy with. I believe that getting different opinions can help to solidify the choice you are making as the best one you could choose. Getting more than one opinion makes you more open minded to things you haven't tried before. An example I have is when I went shopping with my friends. While we were shopping we picked out outfits for each other. I got to try on stuff I never would have chosen on my own or with my sister. I found things I absolutely loved that I would not have tried without their advice. When you get different opinions you also widen your option of choices to choose from. Five years ago when my family was getting my current dog, we went looking on pet websites. There was a pet store we always went to and decided to maybe get a puppy from there. It wasn't until we found out from our friends who had got a puppy from there that many dogs from that store get sick. It was basically a puppy mill. My mom went and found reviews for the store online. She found a review that said a certain breeding place in Maryland was the place to go instead. Taking that lady's advice we drove down to Maryland and got my dog who is still with me today. She is one of the best choices I have ever made and i'm grateful that we found her. I don't think that we would have went to this specific breeder without the advice from reviews and our friends. Getting different opinions can affect even more simple things in daily life. My example is ordering off a menu. As I get older, instead of just ordering the things my parents tell me to get, I may ask the waiter or a person who goes there often for their opinion on the best stuff there. This gets me to try new things and makes my meals more fun. Getting different opinions gives you more variety in life based on others' life experience. All in all, I still think that getting multiple opinions on different advice can help someone to make the best choice possible. When I seek different opinions I can get a different view on the topic, it makes me sure my choice is the best one by learning from others' stories and opinions. It also makes me more prone to trying new things. I think that you should always get advice from different people because they all have different experiences in life. I know that even in the future I will still want to have different opinions to be able to reflect and learn from.\n",

      "Error processing text: Distance learning has become a worldwide phenomenon to parents and guardians as well as educators as they begin to navigate through the vast advancements in technology and the several opportunities available to future students to ensure happiness and prosperity at least once in their lifetimes. Most parents do not take the time to consider and realize that this type of learning is actually increasingly becoming popular over time. Distance learning teaches students to nurture their talents and skills while learning to find an interest in a career pathway. Across the numerous nations around the world, future generations of students are noted to benefit from distance learning because it allows a student to delve into their own learning and apply it to the real world as well as provide an insight behind the true meaning of responsibility while learning to form the correct work ethics necessary for success. Distance learning from home allows the student to understand the material taught by the educator more than in a typical classroom environment by submerging into the detailed gist of all things while making connections to the real world through the handson activities and resources available to ones' own fingertip. For example, Generic_Name, a current junior in high school, is able to understand her trigonometry course and the vital means behind the formulas through a classroom activity of calculating the heights of several trees and buildings around her neighborhood. The activity that Generic_Name proudly completes demonstrates her understanding of the unit through a submitted presentation and a sheet of paper with her calculations proven correct. Through the activity handed to Generic_Name, she has gained a new skill that could be beneficial for her in the future if she decides to pursue a career in architecture or math. With this in mind, she would have not learned how to use that entire course load of information if she had attended a regular math class at the nearby high school. In a normal classroom environment, she would have been taught the material and the usage of the formulas like any other student in the county as well as have been asked to demonstrate her understanding through an exam, which does not really show that she understands the material to the fullest potential. Moving further along, Generic_Name, another high school student within the state of Virginia, has also displayed his passion and desire for his favorite course, Earth Science, through various field trips to the lake and pond near his house. Through distance learning, Generic_Name understands the material through the readings and labs at the comfort of his home. The labs allow him to be on the search for specific animals and rocks, which further peaks his interest about the environment. Without the course load available to him within his reach, he might have not had found his passion and the available opportunities to excel in that area. Distance learning plays a major role in the future of these students by building up the necessary skills and desire to pursue a dream. Furthermore, the availability to learn and take courses from the comfort of your home opens up the opportunity for the student to learn the real meaning behind responsibility that comes along with taking these courses in this manner as well as the ability to correct any bad work ethics before heading to the workforce in the near future. An individual that exemplifies the benefit of distance learning is Generic_Name, a commuter college student, living in Generic_City with his two parents. For the most part, Generic_Name takes his classes online to ensure that all of his graduation requirements are met with the degree he aspires to receive in education. One of his teachers had assigned an activity to him that involved a visit to an elementary school in the area. Back in high school, he would have made the decision to slack off and turn the assignment a day later than the original due date, but things have changed for the better as he entered college. His online class has allowed him to go at his own pace accordingly to a deadline. He would receive absolute no credit for a late assignment in college, and often times, Generic_Name would now make the decision to ensure that all things are turned in. Generic_Name understood the responsibility behind his course load and visiting the several elementary schools as a teacher aide after all, he would contribute his time to assist the little kids that were eager to learn. Working with kids for his assignment has given Generic_Name an insight into the type of teacher he would become. Generic_Name, a twentyyearold college student in nursing, has tremendously seen the change as well in her work ethic. She used to keep her thoughts all to herself, but with the help of her online nursing class, she was able to openly express her opinions in class discussions as well as live lessons. She has successfully skyrocketed and almost reached her full potential because of distance learning. Distance learning has taught her valuable life lessons that she will forever be grateful for. It has taught her to be open and responsible to her patients at all costs. Success can be found from the comfort of your home through online classes. Thousandths of students that actively involve themselves in distance learning has demonstrated a strength in building responsibility and vital work ethics as well as connecting their course load to the real world in hopes of truly finding a passion. Taking responsibility for ones' own actions while ensuring that tasks are done in a correct manner is critical in the workforce of today. In addition, it is also important that the individual finds joy in learning as they get older, and applying that new information to their work or lives on a daytoday basis. Education is both found and reached in many ways possible at last, all individuals should continue to stay curious and keep searching for that never ending desire to learn more little by little.\n",

      "Error processing text: In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college. I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that. I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job. There are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job. Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams. This doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have. In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.\n",

      "Error processing text: Ah, the great smell of pollution hitting your face as you walk out the door the way the polluted air puts a haze over your eyes. There is nothing better than that when you begin to start your day every morning. Most people do not seem to enjoy the slap in your face you get when you just cannot seem to get enough air into your lungs. The use of cars has be steadily decreasing over the years, and public transportation are beginning to be used more, and more. Along with this, cities are even beginning to ban the usage of cars. This has become an idea that has spread globally and everyone is beginning to take an interest to have the pollution level lowered, and to make the air much cleaner. It is time to inform you, that places around the world big, and small are beginning to ban the usage of cars. Cities as big as Paris, France have banned car usage to bring down the pollution levels found in their great cities. Vauban, Germany, a suburban community, has completely given up their cars, in which car owners must purchase a spot for their car in a garage that can cost up to fortythousand dollars. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal in, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , seventy percent of vaughn's families do not even own cars, and fiftyseven percent of the people living there chose to sold their cars before they moved there. vaughn's ideas has been spread throughout the world and now other suburbs are beginning to want to make places denser and make everything a walking distance away. Cities as great as Paris, France enforced a partial ban on driving cars to clear the air of the city, which was said by Robert Duffer in, Paris bans driving due to smog. Paris had made it easier to get public transportation while the ban was being enforced by making public transportation free of charge Friday to Monday. With pollution levels higher than ever with the amount of factories and cars, in congested cities it is a good idea for car usage to go down to allow the air to clear from pollution. Limiting the amount of car usage will clear the air we breathe, and allow us to inhale deeper breaths. In addition, there are many different forms of transportation that can be used instead of just the average car, you may use bikes, rollerskates, skateboards longboards, and penny boards, or even just a simple walk to get to places. Attempting to minimize the usage of everyone using a single car to get to a place a carpool, taxi, bus, train, or subway can be another means of transportation that may be used. This will limit the amount of traffic on the streets, and minimize the amount of pollution that is going into the air. Some will say that not driving to your destination yourself will take more time whether it be because you have to wait for your specific train to arrive, or waiting for the taxi to show up to your doorstep, you have to wait a few extra minutes to leave for your destination. In reality, that few extra minutes you have waiting for the taxi can be stopped you can do this by, calling the taxi a few minutes before you want to leave so that it will arrive precisely when you want it too. With the use of bikes, walking, or skating everywhere you go, you will also begin to get into better shape, as you are moving towards your destination. The usage of cars for only trips that will take hours will also help to save you money on gas, and your car millage. Furthermore, by beginning to add neat sidewalks, parks, and everything in a walking distance people will be encouraged to walk more and will not have reason not to use their car. Elisabeth Rosenthal states in, The End of Car Culture , that even in America the usage of car is beginning to dtop down steadily. The amount of young people getting their driver's license is starting to decrease and has gone down twentythree percent between 2001 and 2009. She also state at the Mobile World Congress the proposed the idea that they should partner with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety. With people beginning to take interest in other means of transportation cities, and towns alike will begin to make things a walking distance to meet the obscure demand from the people. In conclusion, people around the world are beginning to take interest in lessening the usage of cars in their cities, and towns. Cars have began going down in sales and less people are buying them. Other means of transportation have come up that will begin to benefit us health wise. Making us healthier by excercising and clearing our air of toxins found in pollution. If cities around the world begin to decrease the amount of car usage our air will become much clearier and satisfying to live in. It will make getting to destinations much safer with the less chance of accidents and injuries from motor vechicles. Reducing car usage will begin to change the world by making it a much cleaner, healthier place to live.\n",

      "Error processing text: Is the use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System valuable to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom?. In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technolgy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promissing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a sudent is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it hepls the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them. School brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the techers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or thewy might be confused but afraid to speak up so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It also states Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor. By this evidence , the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored this would allow them to think throught about changing a new method to teach so the studetns don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The mayority of students nowdays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success but they don't implement it, so what is best than a new tehnology to help out a little. There are 6 basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time.. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states Eckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. It also states The software can even identify mixed emotions as in Da Vinci's masterpiece. Each expression is compared against a neutral faceshowing no emotion. This evidence illustrates by the aouthor shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don't have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out becuase no one knows what the mixed feelings are . Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with ths technology teahcers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenari to help them out. Emotions are everywhere, everyone experience at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of learing to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states The Mona Lisa is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. It also states Most human communication is nonverbal, incluiding emotional communication. By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helos to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic. Now, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher woulld be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions Teachers wouldn't have to be guessing the emotions of the studetns, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, becuase they already know what is going on. In the classroooms it is very hard for the sdtudents to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue beuase the sdtudents just don't communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion. Is really interesting what this technology can do.\n",

      "Error processing text: Did you know its proven that extracurricular activities boost student academic performance in subjects they are taking? Well I for one agree with the principal's decision that every student should take at least one extracurricular activity.This is because of my satisfactory experience with soccer for the school varsity team soccer as an extracurricular activity for me has been beneficial in ways such as providing me and teaching me principlesessential fundamentals that are used in real life scenarios such as collaboration, and teamwork,it is a productive break from school, and soccer has kept me in good shape and, physically in a healthy condition because of practice, and other things required to play the sport. So because I took soccer and it has helped me with those aspects in characteristic traits,being a productive break, and keeping me healthy, everyone should participate in an extracurricular activity and abide by the principals decision. One reason to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer and support my position is because it guides students into learning traits like collaboration,team work, and communication components used in soccer, and they carry out to a students daily life. For example before I took soccer as an extracurricular activity I didn't know how to work with people and that lead to me doing bad in group assignments we had one for science where we worked on a environmental poster I did not know when to share Idea's,take leadership, or surprisingly how to ask for help! However, when I took soccer we worked on those fundamentals in training you learn how to pass, how to ask for the ball, and how to get support from your teammates,etc. Those ideals carried on to my personal life and I noticed I started having better coordination with my peers in the science project also just groups in general. Therefore all students should take at least one extracurricular activity so they learn the vital skills such as the ones I learned in soccer which improves coordination,communication,collaboration, and many more these skills carry onto daily life for a student and make real life scenarios easier to deal with. Another way soccer has benefited me and proves every student should take an extracurricular activity is because they act as productive breaks from school. Studies have shown students spend about 2 hours on their phone daily, we can all infer these 2 hours were spent on their free time because phones aren't allowed to be used in school. This fact is accurate for me because before I took soccer, I spent most of my time for recreation on my phone it acted as a very unproductive break and didn't benefit me in any way all I did was scroll through social media, but that all changed when I emerged my self into soccer. Those hours I spent on my phone were all replaced with productive training and it was more enjoyable than scrolling through Instagram I also found my self less guilty and soccer provided me benefits way more superior then just staying at home and doing nothing with my time of leisure such as the benefits listed in this essay, healthiness,a guide of skills,etc. Ultimately, students should be required to take an extracurricular activity such as soccer because of how they act as productive breaks from the useless addictions of teens such as phones,video games, and many more, and they provide more benefits then those leisurely activities. Finally, the last reason to support the principals decision is because extracurricular activities like soccer or regarding sports, and activities that get adolescents moving, make them physically more healthy and make exercise fun for students. My personal problem used to be weight before I took soccer I was 5'10 and 160 pounds I found exercise UNenjoyable, and was on my way to face the huge problem of American Obesity. Since I loved the sport so much I naturally lost 30 lb since soccer requires a lot of cardiovascular training such as running. I also found my self doing other exercises to help my self get better at the sport such as swimming,yoga, and much more! It is a known fact that people who are more fit tend to look after them selves, and move around much more than the average Joe. Therefore, extracurricular activities such as soccer are important and one should be taken by at least every student because they provide a healthy amount of exercise that is enjoyable, in a students daily life, and can solve problem such as being overweight. In conclusion I support the principals decision to require extracurricular activities for every student. Because of my experience with taking soccer has provided me traits relevant to real life scenarios such as team work,collaboration and many more other traits important for real life, It acted as a productive recreational activity while substituting for my phone usage, and at last it has made me a healthier student, and stopped me to my path to obesity. So whether its soccer,football,media communications for the school,or any other activity I cannot stress enough the importance of extracurricular activities, and I definitely agree with the principals decision for the requirement. The fact extracurricular activities are proven to boost student performance in subjects is more than enough of a reason to partake on an activity, don't you think?\n",

      "Error processing text: Summer break for teachers and students is a great resting period to rejuvenate for the next, upcoming school year. Students are not overwhelmed by the constant workload, while teachers get a welldeserved break from planning. Concerned individuals, such as parents and teachers, believe that during this twomonthbreak, students do not continue to learn or keep their minds fresh with knowledge. Due to this, most schools give out packets and other tedious work to keep students busy on their time off. Some schools even require students to do summer projects to be sure they will continue to learn outside of school. These projects could possibly be teacherdesigned or studentdesigned. Students should complete summer projects that are studentdesigned because it promotes creativity, students will be more likely to complete them, and it will allow them to be more engaged in something that interests them. However, there are some people who may disagree with this point of view because teacherdesigned projects would be more specific and perhaps more relevant to that teacher's class subject. if summer projects were teacherdesigned, teachers would have the opportunity to provide students with project guidelines to prevent them from feeling overwhelmed or discouraged. Guidelines for these projects would narrow topics down and give the student a better understanding of what his or her project should consist of. Nevertheless, studentdesigned summer projects would be highly conducive to students because they would allow them to have the freedom to exemplify creativity and give them the chance to think outside of the box. Allowing the assigned projects to be studentdesigned would promote the creativity of all students. Being that it is summer, the students should be able to have fun and look forward to their projects rather than feel overwhelmed by them. If the projects are designed by the students, they would have no choice but to plan out and execute their project plans to the best of their ability. This forces their minds to fully think and map out their assignments to know how they would like them to turn out. Because of this, students would have to engage in various research activities which is a vital life skill and would be further conducive to them. In my English class, I was assigned a summative project on the topic of global problems and I was left to come up with a local solution. The choice of the global problem was up to me and I was urged to come up with my own effective local solution. After making a decision and solving it locally how I saw best fit, I had to display this somehow, whether it was by an advertisement, radio podcast, TV commercial, etc. It was all up to me and I had complete freedom to choose something that was really important to me. This was really motivating to me because I was genuinely passionate and interested in the topic of my choosing. Providing students with a creative outlet when doing work can grab their attention and spark an interest ultimately causing them to score higher on assignments. Students will be more likely to do the projects if they have the option to design them. Teacherdesigned projects could discourage a lot of students from completing them due to a lack of motivation or interest. A lot of the time, students are assigned summer homework, whether it be reading, writing, or math packets. Although teachers make these assignments mandatory to be completed and turned in on the first day, the sad reality is most students don't have their assignments done on time for the returning school year. This is because the students are not interested, let alone engaged. The teacherdesigned summer assignments allow no room for fun or creativity that sparks an interest in children, therefore the assignments do not get done. In 7th and 8th grade, me and my peers were asked to do summer break reading logs and summaries. We were allotted the full, twomonthbreak to fully and thoroughly complete them, yet on the first day of school, hardly anyone had brought them in for credit. This was simply because they did not care enough to have them done over the summer. While students may do their work when school is in session, it does not guarantee they will do it during break. The more creative freedom given to them to do these assignments, the higher the chances are of them getting completed. If students are actually interested in their projects, they will be more engaged and have higher quality work. Every student is passionate about something and if they are given the opportunity to showcase what is is they're passionate about, the work would be remarkable. It is a proven fact that students learn better when they are truly interested and fascinated by the curriculum. Being engaged also allows students to expand their knowledge. Learning becomes fun to a student when they care about the things being taught, and when learning becomes fun, students desire to know more to develop a higher understanding of what it is they are fascinated with. Providing students with the chance to be creative and design their own projects will, overall, be what is best for them. They will get the opportunity to excel due to a genuine interest in the projects of their choice. Students will feel less overwhelmed and stressed by work designed by their teachers and will feel more motivated to complete the assignments given to them. Summer break for students is a time to feel stressfree and relaxed before returning back the following year. The projects given during that time should be a way to express their creativity and also be a fun way to learn more about something. The best way to keep a student engaged over the summer is by letting he or she choose an area of interest and letting them explore as much as possible. Studentdesigned projects are the best way to make sure students continue learning and growing over the long summer break.\n",

      "Error processing text: During summer break, many teachers will assign a project that is designed to give students the freedom to work at their own pace and fully discover and interesting topic. When this project is designed too specifically by the teacher, however, many students become disinterested and only do the bare minimum of work. In order to keep students motivated, and make the project beneficial in their future lives, students should be allowed to design their own project for the summer. Studentdesigned summer projects motivate pupils to create higher quality products, solve diverse realworld problems, and develop unique skill sets that cannot be learned inside the classroom. On the other hand, there are many who support the use of teacherdesigned summer projects, because they are more related to the subjects taught in school and thus more useful in furthering students' education. Opponents cite several studies that show students forget nearly ten percent of what they learn in school over summer break. With a teacherled project during the break, students will be encouraged to remember and use what they have learned in school instead of letting months of hard work in school go to waste. While it is true that students will learn more of the curriculum through a teacherdesigned project, a better use of the time during summer is to teach subjects not covered in the curriculum. Topics that are specific to certain career fields can only be learned through independent study, and studentled summer projects are the most effective way to encourage this kind of study. When students are given the freedom to choose a project that plays to their interests and learning style, instead of being forced to do a certain project by their teachers, the quality of the students' projects improves dramatically. One way that this freedom encourages a higher quality project is by increasing student engagement. Modern psychological studies have shown that students are less driven to succeed at a task if they feel they are being forced to accomplish it. Students allowed to choose their own summer project would not feel forced into a specific course of action, increasing their engagement in the assignment and thus the overall quality of their final project. Designing their own project also creates a higherquality product by adapting it to their own learning styles. Psychologists working in the field of memory have found that students often learn best in one of four learning styles ReadingWriting, Auditory, Visual, or Kinesthetic. With the ability to adapt the requirements of the assignment to their learning styles, students would create a higherquality product with much less unnecessary effort. Because of this increase in quality, studentdesigned projects are also very effective at solving realworld problems. Projects that have been chosen and designed by students create solutions to realworld problems in ways that teacherled ones cannot. By deciding on their own projects, students can pursue interests that lie outside of the usual subjects found in school. Summer projects designed by teachers usually focus on one of the few categories of science, english, or mathematics that schools teach. Students who are provided the opportunity to design a project on their own will be able to pursue fields of study that are not touched on by schools, gaining knowledge in many other diverse areas of study. In addition, the ability to choose their own projects allow students to tackle problems that face our world today with their own unique solutions. As one example of this, a team of students who chose their own project for science class was able to create groundbreaking new technology for removing floating debris from the ocean, which has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people who depend on the health of the ocean to survive. If more students could pursue their interests in the same way that this team did, many new solutions to today's problems would emerge. In addition, students who pursue their own interests in this way are also much more prepared for their chosen careers in the future. Studentdesigned projects develop unique skills in students that are not learned through teacherled study. One skill that independent projects teach is the ability to do creative, independent work. As adults, many find that leadership positions in the workplace require some degree of creativity, and tasks must often be completed with little input from those higher in the chain of authority. By allowing students to produce their own ideas and work on their own schedule, rather than assigning students ideas and schedules, studentled projects encourage the traits that are necessary for any productive member of society. In giving students the independence to try out their own ideas, these projects also allow students to learn skills that are not covered by the main subjects of traditional schooling. For example, a student interested in becoming a veterinarian would not learn very much about his or her desired career through the core classes, but would learn a great deal through a project requiring him or her to study animals. Studentdesigned projects, therefore, are much more effective than teacherdesigned ones when it comes to preparing students for their future professions, and for their future lives as a whole. When students are presented the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they become motivated to improve the quality of their work, make a lasting impact on the real world, and develop unique skills that can aid them in future careers. When students are given the freedom to choose who they want to be early on in their lives, they become better equipped in the future to make their dreams a reality. In order to produce students who are skilled, effective, and motivated to succeed, teachers should allow their students to choose what subjects they would like to explore during the summer.\n",

      "Error processing text: I agree with Michelangelo's statement as I have found through experience that it benefits me more to set high expectations and not reach my goal, rather than settling on a low goal and achieving it. When setting high goals, I find that I learn more and progress my abilties further than I do with a lower goal. This is because setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Firstly, hard work is required to achieve high goals, and requires confidence. Confidence involves having trust and believing that you are capable of accomplishing something. I have found that when I set high goals, I feel more confident in my abilities. With lower goals however, my confidence is lower as I settle for the easier path and do not trust myself to do better. With a higher aim, my confidence motivates me to not give up. I tend to try harder, and always believe in myself. For example, at school, I had to choose whether I wanted to try out for the varsity tennis team or remain in the club team. The varsity team was a higher reach, and required confidence in my abilities for me to try out. The club team was a lower reach, as I knew that I could simply continue with it. I decided to try out for the varsity team, and was confident in my abilities. I practiced hard and did not give up. Despite not making it onto the team, I found that I actually greatly improved my abilities through the confidence I had gained, and tried harder than I had ever before. I managed to progress my skills, and was able to play more confidently on the club team and excel. Therefore, setting high aims requires confidence, which is a very beneficial characteristic to have in life. Secondly, setting a high goal indicates a challenge. It will be more challenging to attempt to aim high rather than aiming low, yet this will also prove more benefits. With a challenge, I tend to be more motivated as I want to prove my capabilites. I try harder, and in return get further. Even if I fall short of my high aim, I tend to get further than I would have if I had settled with a lower aim. With lower goals, there is no challenge, and so once the aim is achieved any effort stops. Learning is limited to that low expectation, and will not be able to go beyond. For example, in my high school career, I have always struggled with picking between two types of courses honors or academic. Honors is the more challenging course, which requires more work and effort and would pose as more of a challenge. Academic however, requires the bare minimum and is easy to succeed in. In the honors course, I would be setting my aim high yet might not get the grade I want yet, in the academic course, my aim would be low and I would most likely get the grade I want. After hard consideration, I decided to opt for the honors course. This course may be a challenge, yet would allow me to learn more. I enjoyed the challenge, and found that it motivated me to try harder to try and accomplish my goal. Even if I fell short of my ideal grade, I was proud to have tried my best and felt that I learnt so much more. The course benefited me more than the academic course would have, despite not receiving the grade I hoped for. Therefore, challenging oneself with a high aim allows for more flourishing and encourages more learning. Overall, setting a high aim will pose more benefits. Thirdly, pride accompanies setting high goals. When setting low aims, I feel that it is easy to achieve the goal. However, with high aims, it is more challenging to achieve the goal, and so I feel proud of myself for attempting it. Pride is a very important characteristic, as it increases self esteem. With a higher selfesteem, I tend to try harder and feel more powerful with my abilities. I am more likely to learn and improve upon my abilities, which overall allows me to succeed. For example, in high school I had the opportunity to write a poem and submit it into a writing competition. This was a high aim, as the goal was to win. I felt very proud of myself for taking the time to write and challenge myself with this competition, and ended up writing my favorite piece yet. I submitted my writing, and did not win. However, I felt very proud of myself for having tried so hard and was able to learn and flourish in my writing abilities. Now, I am more likely to sign up for competitions, even if I do not win, simply because I enjoy the challenge and feel that I am able to learn. I feel proud of myself for taking on these challenges. Therefore, setting high goals emmits pride, which can prove very beneficial in life. In conclusion, I agree with Michelangelo's statement. Setting high aims and falling short can bring so many more positive effects than setting low aims and accomplishing them. This is because setting high aims requires confidence, challenges, and pride. These characteristics are very important in succeeding, and can encourage learning and progression in abilities. Through setting low goals, learning becomes stagnant. In order to flourish and continue learning, setting high goals is crucial, even when not achieving the goal.\n",

      "Error processing text: To acess what one needs in the world today, many would think one needs a car. Currently, cars are a big part of transportation for many people. However, they are also major contributers to negative environmental impact as well as the decline of cities public areas and transportation. Contrary to popular belief, limiting car usage can be benefcial to many. Currently, throughout the world several car free systems are operating well. A decrease in the number of cars on streets and highways would lead to positive improvments in public spaces, public transportation, and the environment as a whole. Automobiles are one of the biggest ailments to the sustainment of a healthy environment. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In Paris bans driving due to smog, author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. Congestion was down 60 in the capital of France, after fivedays of intesifying smog. It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change. The reduction of cars also leads to development. In Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky, improvments to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up. Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In The End of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety. Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport. As many begin to see the importance of car reduction, they are becoming less reliant. In The End of Car Culutre by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny. In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and carpooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary. The decrease in usage of and reliance on cars is important and positively impactful. As number of cars on the road continues to go down, so do global issues such as the deterioration of the environment. Communities grow to orient themselves around public spaces accessable to all. Getting a significant number of automobiles off the road plays a huge role in inciting change that benefits a wide array of people in the way of work, time, money, and more, in communities and worldwide.\n",

      "Error processing text: As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons. When you consult multiple people, however, the room for error decreases significantly. For example, if you needed to write an unbiased paper on the pros and cons of making abortion legal, asking more than one person would limit the scope of the bias. If you only asked one individual, their statements could be tainted if they had a preexisting opinion on the topic. However, if you were to consult multiple people, the scope of the bias would be severely limited. The more people, the less bias you risk, so asking only one individual could end up ruining a supposedly unbiased report. Not only is bias a problem to consider when asking individuals, making sure their statements are accurate can be equally if not more important. When asking people for advice, you must always consider whether what they're saying is actually true. Bias is incredibly important to weed out, but often fact checks can also help root out some bias too. Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions. When attempting to rephrase a sentence that sounds strange or incorrect, or when trying to add more detail and glamour to an otherwise boring sentence, there is no right or wrong answer. Certain techniques may work better or worse, but there is never a fix all type solution. So when taking advice from someone who, for example, is helping you edit your paper, some things they say you cannot fact check with Google or a textbook. If you were to only consult this individual, they would have full control, and may make suggestions that aren't the best for your paper. That's why, especially when dealing with highly opinionated topics like rephrasing sentences and adding additional detail, its crucial to consult multiple people and make sure most agree with your changes to ensure they're the best for your paper. Oftentimes in a writing help after school club I'm a part of, we have to deal with problems like these where students need more detail, but there's really no right and wrong way to phrase the sentence. That's why we consult each other to make sure every change we make is for the good of that persons writing. Wednesdays, after school, I work as a consultant to the writing center. In the club, younger students, usually from seventh grade, come to get help with their writing from older, more experienced students. Many times, seventh graders come in with half finished essays that could barely be considered rough drafts, but as it turns out they've already turned them in and need to rewrite them for a higher grade. The process can be difficult, and sometimes grueling if the seventh grader doesn't want to and cooperate, but I still love consulting. Working there is a joy, but one of the things that really makes us able to go above and beyond to help other students is the ability to cross check with other consultants and work together. Often, seventh graders are assigned only one consultant to help them with their work. However, like I've said above, one persons opinion can definitely be flawed. This is why we employ many talented consultants, so if one doesn't know what to do or accidentally makes a mistake, others can catch it and further assist them. Asking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes.\n",

      "Error processing text: In this time, where technology is something that we need to live, educations is not an exception. Technology offer us many way to facilite our way to live, it can have many point of views. As a person that lives in the Millenial time, it can be very helpful to have an education online, but at the same time required a lot of responsability from part of the student. Online education is something that is very flexible with our schedules, as an student, I attend school, but at the same time I have to work, so here is the point, with online education you have the facility to control all your schedule and also you can still have free time. But there is people that don't think the same, my father always told me that eduaction is the base of all, and in some way an online class its never going to be the same as a common class, it can have cons and pros. A con, is that when you are taking an online class you are required to buy all the material that you need, you do not have the accesibility to ask questions and be inmmediatly anwser, and also its cover some topic very quickly. Pros, one of the major reasons why people choose online education is because, they have the control of their schedule, they can take classes in any place through smart devices like, Ipads, cell phones, etc. Another major pro, is the price, we can compare this two, and if you are going to get the same level of education by less of the price, it can be a major reason why people choose this option. Now lest talk about tips to take an online course, one of the things that people should think about when they want to take any couse, or class online is their level responsability, during the last summer, I took the English 12 class, and the very first thing that my consuler told me was, It is a lot of work, be responsable! So one of the thing that you should make before the first class start is, make an schedule, create a time to start and finish each module of the class, also, take a time to make a little research of topics that you did not understand. Many of the times you are going to feel frustration, but the best thing is ti take a deep breath and keep going. I found these tips helpful because, apart of the classes, you actually are working in your own respondability, you are developing a new skill, however, we still have the common and conventional eduaction, and as well it has prons and cons, when talking about your social like this one is the best, why? you are able to create your socal group, people that is interested in the same thing that you like, you see differents poits of view, you are around people that can even help you with your future, while in the online, you sometimes don't even know who is your teacher. Another pro, is the fact that the institution that you are studing can bring you many opportunities, like, materials, jobs, schoolarships, etc. The cons of the regular education, you are required to follow a certain schedule, It can take many time that you can use for many other things, and sometimes you take classes that are totally unecessary. We can see many difference in these two, but they have in commin one thing, and is that they both bring us education, we develop new skill, we learn new thing. In conclution, many school, colleges, universities, etc, are using these new way to lear, online eudation can give us a great level of eduaction, it can work more with our schedules, and its you basically can learn anywhere. Implementing online educations can benefit our young society, why? because they are going to learn about responsability, also, not many people have the opportunity to pay for a private and regular education that can cost sometimes 60 more, so we would be helping people with low resources to have an education. We have to understand that there is millions of students that work and have to study at the same time and sometimes they don't have time to turn their respectives assigments at the time they were required, however, there are many and very different options with online educations, some colleges, offer two years doing your carrer online, and the other two you have to attend the college, but paying less of the price. With online eduaction we can contribute a lot of talented people out there, and also many adults can take this classes while working, its is a benefit not just for teenagers, adults that want to have a diplome in an are that they like, but they coud never study, online education is the tool for these people, technology is a great advance that give many great resources that can help us daily. As an student I suppor online education,because it contribute with the development of my generation, and help many people with low resorces that don't have the acces to pay a regular education.\n",

      "Error processing text: The Way In Which We Move Here in America, with our broad expanses and suburban ideals Rosenthal, para. 3, the automobile is the way in which we move it takes us to school, to the office, to our homes, to the homes of others, to distant, unexplored places. Entire buildings and businesses are dedicated to this wonderful invention. However, as American culture shifts and we focus less and less on the car itself, the advantages to limiting our use of this tool become increasingly evident less polluted air, more costfriendly alternatives, and the bonding of whole communities. This turnaway from a carfocused society could certainly change the American perspective on the automobile industry as a whole. Cars, despite some of their clear advantages, cannot provide the necessary advantage of lesspolluted air. Automobiles in the United States can produce up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in carintensive regions European passenger cars can produce up to 12 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Europe Rosenthal without cars, these greenhouse gas rates dramatically drop. One example of this is the temporary ban of driving a car in Paris due to recordbreaking smog levels. According to an article by Robert Duffer, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog, and that colder nighttime weather and warmer daytime weather caused the warmer air to trap car emissions. People from other countries also seem to be enthusiastic about limited car use and its effects. Carlos Arturo Plaza of Bogota, Colombia, who participated in his city's 3rd annual Day Without Cars, says that 'It's a good opportunity to...lower air pollution' Selsky. In our own country, as Americans buy less cars and register for less driver's licenses, sociologists can conclude that it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants Rosenthal, para.6. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will allow cleaner air, which could eventually lead to healthier living standards across the globe, as well as healthier and more diverse ecosystems and biomes. With the limited use of cars, this could all be a possibility. Not only will this restriction of car use allow for less air pollution, it could also lead to producing more costfriendly methods of transportation. Cars and their accessories are often expensive to maintain and to purchase, so the creation of other ways to get around are a must to those who cannot afford such maintenance or purchases. In a passage by Andrew Selsky, he states that Bogota's Day Without Cars has allowed for the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, along with broad, smooth sidewalks, to travel on. In the booming and populous city of New York, its bikesharing program and skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls Rosenthal allow the world to see the shift towards cheap yet affective alternatives to transportation. Michael Sivak, research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, has a son who uses Bay Area Rapid Transit, even though it often takes longer than driving, simply because it is cheaper and a car is simply not a priority Rosenthal. Alternative transportation is definitely on the rise as car usage becomes less and less of a trend. While all of these advantages to limited car use affect us all, the one that will most directly and immediately affect people is the bonding of whole communities. When car use is reduced, there is more opportunity for interaction with others, whether it be through modern technology such as the cellphone or social media, or through facetoface communication as seen in a good oldfashioned conversation between two people. Various factors, according to Mimi Sheller, professor at Drexel Unviersity, are accountable for this community bond the Internet, which allows for connection with people without driving to meet them the renewal of center cities to draw in empty nesters Sheller, Rosenthal as well as carpooling apps and services. Vauban, an entirely carfree suburb in Germany, has adopted a nocar policy in an attempt to separate suburban life and automobile use, an asset in a new project known as smart planning. This separation allows its citizens to have more personal interaction, with its businesses being a short walk from their homes and less space to park a personal automobile. This compacted suburban example in distant Germany is also being adopted in some places in America as well, and it may eventually be the future of American suburb life. With these changes come more and more opportunity to delve a deeper connection with the citizens who live in your area. America has long been pictured as one of the world's prime car cultures Rosenthal. It's the home of many famous and renowned automobiles, including the Ford Model T and Detroit, Michigan, where Chrysler automobiles are manufactured and exported all over the globe. However, as the United States evolves into a different sort of country, so does its focus on the car. Restricting use of the car offers up many advantages to its citizens less greenhouse gas emissions, more costfriendly options to transportation, and the opportunity to bond with your community. As the American Dream continues to change, so will the way in which we move.\n",

The students I think that they thought in implore when you implore someone when the situation is very serious and you need something very much. They had importance about the job the decision was of great importance to the future of the business they have importance of this job only person not have tolerance but learning other people what is tolerance is like to allow accept someone or something especially opinions or behavior that you do not agree with or people who are not like you and other word is intolerance the ability to suffer something especially pain difficukt conditions the student only working together but self better so that two or more things are mixed with joined. The other people no have compassion they no are considerable with students I think that they had considerable difficullty in getting the students they have a opinion are work the important is the true they must consider the matter carefully before they make our choice to have something in my opinion I think about someone or something in a particular way. They need considered that not are riks wastoo great to remember or pay attention to something the like the students is they have repect not are angry for no have experience in the job they are intelligent for no have insecurity is this I like not have insecure not are they have security Ilike they\n",

One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didn't know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesn't want to fail this senior year. If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesn't sound right, does it? i'm from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that my child is better than yours. So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didn't seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didn't mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didn't care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School. I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldn't happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didn't know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order? and I said I'm sorry, I didn't know that i have to change my gloves every time. he said It's fine, just change your gloves and make another salad. after that i have always changed my gloves after every order. By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. It's not a really easy job, but the pay is good, 50hour, for a teenager that's a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don't affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane. Me failing makes me stronger, it's like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use 1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least 50 of it. If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it's impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i'm doing homework, pretending like i'm listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didn't want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and i'm making sure that i'm happy, more than anyone else, I'm not going to let any negativity impact my life. My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you, apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and don't let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing. In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn't affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it's a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can't resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called Winston Churchill is right about success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with his opinoin.\n",

      "Error processing text: Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Well, it would make sense for teachers to make these summer projects to prepare students for their upcoming school year. Teachers designing the project allows for students to maybe remember some subjects they may have forgotten and it shows the students what they need to know for the beginning of the year and allows for them to teach themselves. Some people may say otherwise that student designed projects could be equally as helpful and less time consuming and allow students to be responsible for the time they spend on their work, I can prove otherwise, that projects designed by teachers are more helpful in the long run than student designed projects through examples of my Brother, friends and a personal experience. The first example is my brother, who went to school and towards the end, he was ready for school to be over. Once it was over he started to forget things that he's learned after not using it for anything over summer and so he used to have summer projects from his teachers, although he never felt like doing these projects, it would always help prepare him for the upcoming school year and strengthened up some of the areas that became weak overtime. Since then, when school started he was already ahead of some of the other kids in his class allowing him to have a easier time throughout the beginning of the year. Some may argue that student based projects can allow students to work at their own pace but do the same thing as if it was teacher based. However, If these summer projects were studentbased it would really never get done because students like to spend their free time having fun and so students would procrastinate and never work on it till last minute in which wouldn't help them learn anything. Another example is my friends, who aren't big on working over the summer because they don't want to waste their free time before school starts. Usually, they spend their summer going to the mall, skate park, the pool and each others houses. However, once the school released a summer project from one of their teachers, they knew they had to buckle down and do it to get out of the way so they can have the rest of their summer instead of procrastinating and being behind everyone else when school started and not having much time to spend the rest of their summer. Some people may argue that studentbased projects can be self managed and allow students to be responsible to buckle down to complete it too. Although, student based projects allow students to be responsible for doing it or not, the students who aren't responsible wouldn't put these projects as a priority to them and slack off and instead do what they want instead of trying to learn things that would benefit them throughout the school year, while teacherbased projects would make students buckle down and give them a deadline to turn these projects in when school starts making it a priority to work on for every student. The final example is my own personal experience, I once had a studentbased project for English where I had to read 3 books for English but it had to be books of my own choice and I could choose whatever books I wanted to read for the summer project and write what books I had to read down on paper. That was the whole project, and since I had a choice and could read whatever I want, I procrastinated because I didn't like reading and personally didn't want to waste my time doing something I wasn't interested in instead of doing what everyone wants to do during summer which was have fun. So, since I was able to choose my own books I chose books that I thought were interesting and easy and turned out these books were under my reading level and just wrote those books down and continued my summer. The books being under my reading level didn't help me in the long run because once school started we were reading books that looked ten times bigger and longer than what I was used to which applied more stress to me and made it harder to read these bigger books and also affected my vocabulary. Some may argue that studentbased projects allow the teachers to not have to take responsibility for whether students learned anything or not because it also could provide practice in a life skill that is selfteaching which could be helpful in college etc. However, if teachers aren't held responsible for these projects, some students wouldn't be able to learn much compared to those who actually did the project during the summer, making the students who didn't try or challenge themselves fall more and more behind everyone else ultimately hurting their success within the school year. It is important that students are given teacherbased projects to allow students to be taught or retaught and make sure that students actually take the time to do these projects to make their lives easier. In the past there probably weren't a lot of teacherprojects in which made the students upcoming school year probably a lot harder than it should've been. In the future students who have had teacherbased projects could have a better chance at success in later life and can provide skills that can benefit them in later life. If teachers weren't giving out projects that they outlined and allowing students to makeup their own, the world would probably have a lot less successful people who are educated and selfsufficient, and hard working. In conclusion, teacherbased projects are more helpful and can change the intellectual level that children can have and can provide less stress for children and allow them to absorb more of what they're learning through out the school year.\n",

      "Error processing text: Achieving the knowledge based on the books or on the notebooks is common but achieving a knowledge by involving in the extracurricular activities is a different and extra. School is the place where students get suggestion, get inspire, and get strength to accomplish their goals. From school, students can learn optimum knowledge and experiences about the inside and outside of the books as well. In addition, school is the career building place for the students. School is the best place to evaluate the skills and the capability of each students. By controlling students involvement in the extracurricular activities, many students can fulfill their dreams which gives them happiness and makes them feel special by doing it. Also, gives them a wings of hope to do something more and make their parents and themselves proud tomorrow. As we all know that, if the students doesn't have that ability and interest in order to take a particular class then school never force students to involve in those particular class or field. But, talking about family, there are maximum parents who force their children to take a class and choose a career as they want. There are many parents who wants their children to become a doctor, pilot or engineer though, their children doesn't have any interest on that faculty. In other words, though their children are weak in math and science, but their parents wants to make them, a doctor, pilot or engineer. It's only because according to the parents, only doctor and pilot can make a huge money and has a great reputation. At this situation, we have seen many cases that parents do emotionally blackmail to their children. In that condition, children sacrifice their dreams just to make their parents happy. We all know, every student do not wants to become a doctor and pilot. They have their own dreams and interests on particular faculty. For example, if a student is interested and good on soccer but his parents do not support to his interest because they feel it's a waste of time. But, school always support him. According to the parents their children should be good on knowledge based on books rather than extracurricular activities. They should have only focus towards their study which is totally wrong. If schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities then it can show a right path and right decision for the student's bright future. Schools are available with each and every information regarding the bright future of students. If a student is interested on an art then teacher let them to take that class with a huge strength. School knows every skills and talent about their student because they spend more time with their teachers, counselor, friends and their coach than their family. In fact, they share everything about their interest to their teachers and counselors because they understand them. But they do not share those kind of things with their family because family gives only pressure instead of understanding their children's interest. If a student is good on photography then school is the only one who gives more information and put more efforts to help them through different strategies. They try very hard that how students will feel easy and comfortable. Students are also able to learn different knowledge through the school's coach. Coach is the only one who teach, tell and motivate students about their strong and weak point through which student can do better today and give their best tomorrow than yesterday. School provides a beautiful and colorful feathers to the students in order to fulfill their dreams in which faculty they are interested and dying to do for it only by controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities. There are many students who do not have any interest on their study, who do not have any interest on the words written on their notebooks, who do not have any interest to become a doctor, engineer or pilot. Instead, who are interested to become a famous photographer, to become a great dancer, singer and a great actor. These dreams will be remain on dream until they do not get any supports from anyone, if they do not get any motivators to motivate them and also if anyone won't become their inspiration to inspire and encourage them. Similarly, school is that place which do not give their student's dream remain on dream school helps students to give all those things which are needed to them by motivating, encouraging and being inspiration for the students. It also provides an elective classes and other different activities to make them feel happy and special or in order to let their colorful feathers fly in the high sky and able to touch and feel it. At the end, we can see that there are many benefits for the students which also teach them about the importance of extracurricular activities. Therefore, school is that place where it motivate, gives a strong strength to accomplish student's passions, suggest students to go through their interest and teach many significance knowledge about the educational experiences. Because of the schools control student involvement in the extracurricular activities, students can accomplish their interests, dreams and make their career in a particular activity in which they are interested, in which they see a big hope, declare it as their passion and happiness. I believe that not only the students, everyone should follow their passions and see success will comes towards you itself because all we need is our happiness. It is only possible if the schools control students involvement in the extracurricular activities rather than giving decisions to the family and student for the involvement in the extracurricular activities.\n",

      "Error processing text: Cars are a wonderful thing. They are perhaps one of the worlds greatest advancements and technologies. Cars get us from point a to point b. That is exactly what we want isnt it? We as humans want to get from one place to anther as fast as possible. Cars are a suitable to do that. They get us across the city in a matter of minutes. Much faster than anyhting else we have. A train isnt going to get me across the city as fast as my car is and neither is a public bus, but those other forms of transportation just might be the way to go. Don't get me wrong, cars are an absolutly amazing thing but, maybe they just cause way to much stress, and maybe they hurt our environment in ways that we don't think they will. With a bus or a train you do not have to worry about washing your car or getting frustrated when stuck in a bad traffic jam on I4. Also there is not as much pollution in air hurting our environment. You might not think so, but there are many advanteges to limiting our car usage. One advantage that not only humans would benefit from, but also plants and animals is that there would be a lot less pollution in the air hurting out environment. Right now our cars give off gases that are extreamly harmful towards our environment. These gases are called green house gases and come out of the exhuast pipes in our cars. Your car alone dosent give off much gas but collectively, our cars give off enormous amounts of gases. This is especially true in big cities like France. In France, their pollution level was so high it was record breaking. due to that france decided to enforce a partial ban on cars. This is described in the second article Paris bans driving due to smog, by Robert Duffer, On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were orderd to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day. After France limlited driving there congestion was down by 60 percent. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France. So after five days of intense smog, 60 percent of it was clear after not using cars for only a little while. Even across the world in Bogota, columbia they are limiting driving and reducing smog levels. In the third article carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, by Andrew Selsky, it describes the annual carfree day they have to reduce smog. the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. So all over the world people are relizing that wilthout cars, we are insuring the saftey and well being of our environment. The second advantage that would come with limiting car use is less stress. Everyone knows that driving a car causes emence amounts of stress. Getting caught in traffic is a major cause of stress in someones life. Haveing to repeatingly wash your car just to get it dirt again causes stress. Having people in the back of your car screasming and yelling all while music is blasting, causes stress. So obviously driving causes stress. If we were to limit our car usage we would not be as stressed as we usually are. There would be no traffic, no car washes and no one screaming in a small confineded space. In the first article In German Suburb, life goes on without cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a citezen named Huidrun Walter, states When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way. So with out the stress of a car Huidrun Walter is a looser and happier person, less stress equals happier person. In the third article, Carfree dai is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, by Andrew Selsky, it states It's a good opportunity to take away stress.... If we have the opportunity to take away stress, why not take it. It is a huge advantage in our lives to limit driving if it takes away stress. No one wants stress, no one needs stress, and if we have an opportunity to take some of the stress away, take that opportunity. In conclusion, there are many advanteges to limiting car use, one being theat we get to help the environment and two being that it helps reduce stress. Our environment is already screwed up in so many ways, if we can help it to become the healthy enironment it once was, then do it. Stress is proven to impare your personal health, no one wants to be unhealthy and no one wants stress in their life. If you want the environment to get better and you want to reduce stress in your life then take this advantage and impliment it. Some might not think that this is an advantage, but i just explained that it is a clear advantege that has been proved to help the enviornment and reduce stress. Limiting car use is a very effective advantage that really does work in more than one place.\n",

      "Error processing text: I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them. One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out. Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob. Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy. And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them. In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.\n",

      "Error processing text: Generic_Name March 18 2019 Writting SOL Grade 8 Before, I would always like to try and play the guitar. My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I always tried to play the flute. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. I always like to sing along with music or people. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them. Another, thing I like to do is workoutexercise. Doing workoutexercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I used to be in boot camp. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosen't have that type of money to pay the surgery. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. I don't really know what they are doing to me. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I don't think I would fit right in. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt 'll fit right in. I don't think i'll have a great future. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and i've been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment. Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I can't do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place. In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosen't look like it. I have played with my brother before but i'm always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i don't even know. I'm not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops. Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I don't know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I don't know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. That's why I always got to try on it. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades i've been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I can't. In the future I will just not now cause I can't jus try i can't say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. I'm just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I will not only make them proud cause i'll also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully. I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i don't even know if i'll be abke to accomplish it and make it. All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it. Never give up on big dreams like these. Everyone should try to make the best out of you.\n",

      "Error processing text: School projects over the summer are often boring, repetitious, and not engaging in a students interests or specific ideals. It does not have to be this way though, schools and teachers can change the way they assign and grade projects by simply allowing the students to take charge and develop their own projects. Summer projects should be student designed in nature as to promote creativity in the students, allow students to take control of their education, and give students complete and total freedom in how and what to work on. Students deserve the chance to prove that they can really be trusted to engage in their education in their unique and exciting ways, they should not be trapped into a small project that teachers grade all the same. Many people would argue that teacher designed projects are better for students as they provide a clear and easy to follow rubric and guidelines for students to follow. While it is true that a clear outline and specifications would create an easier project for the students and teachers, is the point of a project not to challenge the students to work harder and show off what they know and can do? Student designed projects would not hamper the students by making each project a copy of the last through students following the same guidelines and thinking the same ways to complete the project. Students should control their own project and make it unique and their own special version of a basic idea that the teacher can then grade on a case by case basis instead of treating each project as something that must conform to fit specific rules. Allowing students the ability to truly have freedom is a far superior benefit than that of easier grading and simple goals in a narrow range of a teacher designed project. Student based projects written without a strict rubric in mind will promote creativity and free thought in the students that have to create these projects. If each student is allowed to be the manager and creator of their own works then the students would feel more invested in their efforts and more careful and diligent in what they produce for their project. Students will likely think of new and exciting ideas to implement in their own ways and bring a new level of entertainment and creative thinking into what could potentially be a boring project. Students would almost certainly develop fun, intriguing, and totally unique ways of solving problems, showing off skills, and any other topics that they could think of. Summer projects could only be enhanced beyond what they are now by allowing students the creative and physical freedoms to complete their projects in the ways that they seem fit and are passionate about. If students were allowed to design their own projects over summer then they would take more initiative and control over their own education. Students being forced to adhere to a code of guidelines and mandatory pieces in their projects would take away control from the students and force them to do a project thats been done before just with different words. Allowing students to take control over their education would also help to bring about an end to a problem many students will no doubt face procrastination, as students would make their projects something fun and look forward to working on. In addition to ending procrastination, student designed projects would also mean students would generally work harder and care more about their projects as these would be tasks that they poured their heart and soul into, they would be individually responsible for their own success and feel that they should work harder and give more effort into this project that they alone thought of, created, and worked hard on. Student designed projects are no doubt the future of school work during he summer break partly because of their ability to give the students the pride of control and the strong sense of initiative that simply does not come from a strict, teacher designed summer project. A last detail that proves student based projects are superior is that they give the students complete and total freedom over what to make, how to make it, and when to make it. This means that students would not be restricted to doing a certain task, in a certain way, at a certain time merely to fit with the guidelines of the project that they were thoughtlessly assigned. The freedom to create what they, the students, want is a feeling of euphoria for students, a breath of fresh air in the stale and often controlling school environment. Allowing students to have the freedom of choice, especially over summer when the last thing a student wants is to be burdened with a teachers strict code of demands for a very narrow minded project with simple goals, is a feeling that empowers the students and makes them feel as though their opinions, interests, and personalities truly matter to their schools. Allowing summer projects to be far more than narrow teacher created silhouettes of topics students dont care about could only help the classes and school. To conclude this argument school projects that are assigned over the summer should be totally and wholly student designed with limited specific instruction by the teachers. Firstly, an open ended project without a strict rubric would clearly promote creativity and free thought in the students that must complete said work. Second, students would show more control and initiative over their own education and ways of completing broad assigned tasks. Lastly, students would be granted the freedom to complete and enhance their education and projects with their own unique interests and special considerations. This quite clearly proves that summer projects being teacher designed are inferior to those projects that are thought of, designed by, enhanced by, and supported by individual students and their individual personalities. All teachers and schools should absolutely adopt this doctrine of free choice and open thought in all summer projects.\n",

      "Error processing text: Extracurricular activities are very important to not only your success at school but also your success in life. Not only does being in a club or sport help you grow, it also affects how colleges and bosses see you as a person. Participating in extracurricular activities can open many doors such as, acquiring new skills, becoming a more well rounded person, and meeting new people which can also lead to new opportunities. In life your going to meet many people, some will stick with you and some won't, but you will learn something from each and everyone of them. Extracurricular activities will lead you to meet all of the different people in your school that may share some of the same interest as you. For example maybe a student decides to join the lacrosse team and none of your friends do. The student ends up meeting lots of people who also like trucks and fishing and hunting. If the student would not have participated an extracurricular activity, they would have never met their new friends. Another way doing clubs and sports will help you is the teachers or coaches getting to know you. For instance say an eight grader joins the art club, the art teacher never really knew you before. But, since you have been going to the club the whole year, the art teacher loves your attitude and thinks you are very talented . Then you are picking you classes for high school and you want to do a photography class, but you need you are teachers recommendation. The student that was in the club is more likely to get a recommendation than the kid who just took art. Meeting new people who also may give you new opportunities is a essential and will help throughout life. Accumulating a new skill happens almost everyday to everybody. A skill can range from a way to write a story to a new way to shoot a basketball. In life you obtain so many skills and being in different clubs or activities can help you share them among many people. For example, a student joins the yearbook club. The student has never really been very good with computers, but is really good with cameras. Many of the students who are in that club are great at editing, but dont have great camera skills. With both of the student skills put together they work perfectly, but also the can teach the skills to one another. Another skill that is acquired through any club or sport you decide to do is, how to interact with others. There are many shy people but also many loud people. A shy person can view a very actively talking person and find new skill and maybe they wont be as shy because they know how to start a conversation and since they are in a extracurricular activities with people that share the same interest as them, they will be able to talk about club related subjects. Lastly, someone can learn how to play a sport. A large number of people play a sport, but usually not every sport. So, a student could give a different sport you don't play a shot. Maybe there is a student that runs track, swims, plays soccer and field hockey. But, they decide to play volleyball. Since they are required to do a club or sport they made this decision, but if they were not required to they most likely would have not tried anything new. Once they started playing the learned many skills and ended up being one of the best on the team. Making extracurricular activities mandatory could be beneficial to a lot of students and might even help hem find their true talent. A wellrounded human being can have different definitions, but usually it means someone who can balance. Not the kind of balance of standing or walking across a tightrope, but more like having loads of work to do and getting it done quickly and quietly. It also means to be someone who helps others, which can range from friends to your whole community. At some schools there is Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps. Both Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps help the community and are extracurricular activities. These two clubs usually have people that are caring and want to help others in it, but they also have good grades and manage to do other activities. Another way student are well rounded is when they have multiple friends. While they usually have a few close friends they are also friendly and easily can make friends with anyone who sits with them. With extracurricular activities they could make even more friends or just be nice to someone new. They could also share their actions with new people who might decide to be more like the well rounded student. Finally, they can be friends with the teachers. To build a relationship with the teacher you can join a club that is run by a teacher. It is hard to talk to teachers during class and get to know them. But, once it is the club time and they can talk to a student with fewer people and where the don't have to teach, the student can actually get to know the teacher. This can be helpful in many way, they can understand your way of learning and be able to help you better and like what was mentioned before they can help with a recommendation for school or even maybe a job. Without extracurricular activities people wouldnt be able to be as well rounded as they could potentially be because they wouldn't be able to connect with others. Extracurricular activities could help so many people in all kinds of ways. While their could be some problems with depletion of time, obtaining the skill or even the amount of school work they have to do after. There is ways around those kind of problems and they could easily be fixed. Joining clubs and sports teams can be very beneficial to everyone involved and learning new skills, meeting new people and becoming a well rounded person is just a few reasons to make extracurricular activities mandatory.\n",

Why are boys so mean, she mumbled to herself as she slowly got up and plopped down on the bed. She turned her head to look at her phone and saw thirty text messages from Generic_Name, and a missed phone call from Generic_Name. Its almost as if her fingers moved on their own, as she turned to click on the call back button. Hey, i've been worried sick for you. I'm sorry about your breakup, I know how hard it must be to be going through this. Generic_Name frowned and hung up mid speech, Even if it has been two months since he left me, he was someone extremely important to me. It's not that easy to forget someone who you use to love and see everyday! she said in a ghostly whisper that would make chills go up your spine, but all she could do was break down in tears again.

If you have someone there, they can talk to you and give you their thoughts and view on it. Instead of hanging up on Generic_Name, she should have listened to what she was gonna say. She could have asked Generic_Name what she thinks about whats going on, and she would have helped her and told her what she thinks. Generic_Name could have also called more people she feels comfortable with and told them the same thing and seen what they think of it too so that she can see what other peoples views are and get a better picture of what's going on and how to fix it.

Of course it's important not to take all opinions seriously but you just have to make sure to grab the right ones. If she listens and does take the right ones, than this could help her make better choices and be sure of what she wants. Thank you guys so much, I don't know what I would have done if you guys didn't give me that great advice! said Generic_Name with a huge smile across her face. Generic_Name and Generic_Name smiled but both ended up laughing with joy, proud to have their old friend back. they all flopped down in the green grass and looked up at the bright blue sky, covered by fluffy white clouds that looked so fluffy you could fall asleep on them.

I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many. So we really should not be driving with phone Driving with phone cause more accident studies proves that also drunk driving One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective and it sad because people are dying because someone else action the innocence always gotta to suffer because of someone else's mistakes and the facts that they were on the phone sop someone might be dead or in icu because of the driver who was on the phone chit chatting. Cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk Anyhow cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action.

      "Error processing text: Is learning best guided by students or teachers? Though it is common for teachers to create and assign almost all work for students, the question gives debate to whether assignments over the summer should be designed by teachers or students. Summer projects are becoming required at some schools as a way to assure students continue learning over their break. With this opportunity to work outside the classroom and in the absence of teacher instruction, can students be trusted to design a project that guides themselves in their own learning? Summer projects should be teacherdesigned because teachers have more experience in giving beneficial, adequate assignments, they know the overall performance and understanding of content from students to assign the most suitable project, and teacherdesigned assignments create more uniformity among projects which makes grading and assessment of students' knowledge easier. First of all, summer projects should be teacherdesigned because teachers have more experience in giving beneficial, adequate assignments. For example, it is part of a teacher's job to create assignments for students to help them understand material during the school year. They are the experts in subjects that students must comprehend, so they have a much better idea of the kind of work to give for clear understanding of topics. Additionally, they have given numerous assignments throughout their career as a teacher. With this past experience, they know what type of work is most beneficial and enough to satisfy requirements for comprehension. With these skills, teachers would create a summer project that best combines sufficient learning and work. Opponents may argue that students know more about which assignments are best because they have completed so many of them throughout their time in school, so they would be able to design the most beneficial summer project. While it is true that students have worked on several assignments in class, it doesn't mean they have better knowledge on the most effective way to learn material. The teacher does more than just give out papers they view and grade all students' work, taking note of how well the class does and how to improve. Therefore, they have a more expanded view of what changes need to be made to how topics are taught based on students' performance, and this would aid them in designing the most effective project. All in all, teachers' experience in giving classroom assignments definitely makes them better candidates for creating summer projects, and their knowledge of students' understanding also backs up this claim. Next, summer projects should be teacherdesigned because teachers know the overall performance and understanding of content from students to assign the most suitable project. For instance, teachers spend the whole school year assessing their students in certain subjects. They know how well classes do in certain areas and where they struggle. Therefore, having this data can allow them to assign projects over break that improve target areas and heighten understanding. Also, teachers know the extent to which students have learned particular subjects. With this knowledge, they can design a project that is not too rigorous or filled with too many new, complex topics. Some would argue that students know their own performance and understanding, so they would be able to make a project that accommodates their own knowledge. Though it is true that students know how well they perform on their own, teachers know how well the entire class performs. Therefore, they can create summer projects that accommodate everyone's understanding. Teachers can find what areas everyone needs improvement on and skills that all students have mastered to find the best fit. In this case, collective understanding is better than individual understanding. In sum, teachers' knowledge of students' performance and comprehension would make them better designers of summer projects, and uniformity among students' work is another key benefit that supports the claim of teacherdesigned projects. Third, summer projects should be teacherdesigned because teacherdesigned assignments create more uniformity among projects which makes grading and assessment of students' knowledge easier. For example, teachers generally create one assignment that everyone completes. In this way, all students are practicing with the same information, following the same directions, and producing the same work. When grading, the teacher can spot for gaps in understanding if certain questions are missed or work is shown incorrectly. The same process would be applied to teacherdesigned summer projects, with all students following the same guidelines, and the teacher would be able to view strengths and weaknesses in students' understanding much more efficiently. Others may argue that students would not have as much creativity in their projects if they are teacherdesigned. While it is true that there are some limitations on creativity, it is much more beneficial for there to be some uniformity in students' summer projects. Each student creating their own unique project makes it harder to assess students' understanding of all required concepts without specific guidelines and instructions. All things considered, the uniformity in teacherdesigned assignments makes teachers the preferable option over students in designing summer projects. In conclusion, teachers' higher level of experience in making assignments, their knowledge of students' understanding, and uniformity in teacherdesigned assignments make teachers better picks for designing summer projects. Teachers have a much better understanding of what is best for students to complete in order for comprehension of material. They can see how students perform and create assignments based on what they observe. With these attributes, there's no doubt that teachers are the right choice for designing summer projects.\n",

      "Error processing text: If we think about the words that the British Prime Minister Wiston Churchill sait succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. There is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I believe. So how important is the role that failure plays in the process to reach success and don't loss enthusiasm in the proccess? In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end. Les't think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you. you or people migth say, this is not for me, because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. That could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails you're gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because I came from a coutry of Spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is English, so I remember that in the begin my English was really poor, and I just knwe a few words in English like good morning or the name of some school's supplies, but everytime I did something wrong I learnd something new from that mistake wich make me gain experience in the proccess of my English learning. Even if sometimes is embarasing to say or spell worng a word infront of people you will be learning to do it rigth with the time. Therefore we should see the fails as a good oportunitie to gain more experience. Most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while you're reaching some goal, I'm talking about the change on your own skills. That could be maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. Using the last example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was the most hard part for me, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then traslate that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence but then I couldn't finish it. That was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the begin. Sometimes that happend to me again when I'm doing presentation or when I'm imfront of nwe people that i have never met. But I feel that the practice has been helping me to decrease that problem and now is easier for me to speak with some body in English at school or in my job . Even if you feel bad or embarrassing to fail with the time that will help. You can be improving skills or even descoviring new ones while you fail that is part of the whole proccess of reach success. Maybe for some people the fact of fail is the worst thing that can happend to them in the proccess to reach success some of them could say, You have to do perfect if you want to reach your goals, but I think that we can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and les't say importnat part of reach success. Have you ever heard the words , No pain, No gain, I like that words, because reminds me how good feels when you reach a goal in wich you speend a lot of time or maybe hard work. For example, when you have a big test at school and you have been studing for that test all nigths for a week or even more and the day of the test you know all the anwers for that test and you got an A or A as a grade that feels so good and comfortable to you. Just because of your hard work you are getting all this good grades that you gain by yourself. That is one of the best sensations that you can ever feel or experiment. Using my example agin I can say that all the result of my hard work that I have done helping me to get good gains in my English developing . Not matter howmany times you fail the last feeling is best in the world. Because is the result of all your hard work. Sometimes I remember how hard was for me to star school in a differnt country, but when I see that I'm about to garduate and get my High School diploma it reminds me all the hard work that I have done during this almost 2 years that I have studing here in Generic_School. It could sound bad when you hear the word failure or fail when your trying to reach a goal, but if you think we should see all the forms that this words have. Success is not all about fail there is more. We have to go deeper into that words. As I said fail is a big and important part in the way to reach a goal. Success is a big proccess with branches and one of this branches is the failure. But failure give us more than we think. it give us experience that could prepare us for future problems or future goals, it also prepare or improve your skill and even if you don't have one you could descover one that you didn't notice, and finally, but no less important the comfortable feeling that give you at the end is incredible because remind you all the hard work that you have done. So I think if you don 't want to lloss enthusiasm during the proccess of reach success you shouldnt see the word failure as it is you should go deeper in to try to understand the important role that it plays in the pursuit of success. I just mencion three reasons here but there could be more than three just don't think that just because you fail is the end of the world instead see how failure could help you to reach that important goal your or success. I hope all the time that I've fail in my English speaking will help me to in the future became in a perfect bilingual speaker having my home lenguahge Spanish and my new home lenguage English.\n",

      "Error processing text: Studentdesigned Wouldnt it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, its great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be studentdesigned because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the studentdesigned projects will definitely be less harder. The first reason the summer projects should be a studentdesigned is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers dont give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didnt give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students dont find math interesting beccause they dont like doing math. Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students wont be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didnt reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations. The third reason is because the studentdesigned project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 subheading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we dont have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 subheading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. Its great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldnt give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacherdesigned will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a studentdesigned however, studentdesigned is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacherdesigned will be a lot harder and frustrating to do. In conclusion, studentdesigned is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacherdesigned. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. Its great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents.\n",

However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you don't have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you don't follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules. To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes. you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions. Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person. Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad? Because they will make where do you walk in a way that you must don't want to walk they will make every thing possible to walk in their way and you want to walk in your way thier will make every thing possible they will bother you and no yuo must follow your way and your road to make every thing possible to have your own experiences and your own rules. To conclude people must make their own decition, they should not be with some one else that has experiences or some tipe of company you must star from zero and trow the procces you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and wnet you have more experiences you will get to be more storng and you will grow in the things that you know and some people look at you and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end. On the other hand you must create your own rules you must be very organice on the rules that you make dont follow others person rules make your own rules and went yuo make your own rules you must know what is going to happen if every thing is going to be okay or bad, but if you follow some one else rules you will not know what is going to happen do must make your own rules so you can be unique and a expert. In adition, if you are alone no one is going to bother you in the things that you make becuase you are alone you are the boss no one is going to some some thing to you and you will guide others people went they see that you are alone and no with some one else you will grow alot in the thisngs that you do. Fanally you know now that the best thing is that you should be alone and no with some one else that they will make your own rules and you will learn from their experiences and you will not get to have your own experiences and no one is going to bother you is you are alone because of hall of that you must be alone and star from zere Thanks.\n",

      "Error processing text: The United States has one of the worst public school systems in the modern world. Places like Sweden and Denmark show fantastic, flawless designs that allow students to properly use their time for both school and nonschool activities. Our public schools, however, show many flaws that were enacted by generations in the past. Students fail to learn proper time management, as they are forced to go to places they are unfamiliar with and follow prepared schedules in and out of class. As this continued, the government discovered the flaws and are beginning to try new solutions. One of these solutions is online classes that students can take at home. I believe that Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging information, and build proper time management skills. One of the systems' largest problem is forcing students to attend and learn in places that are unfamiliar and daunting to them. According to majority of students in a poll last year, research has shown that students consider school buildings as uncomfortable, as well as unfamiliar. On that same poll, the same research claimed that students found the idea of learning at home appealing, and a much better suited place to learn. This same evidence supports the ideas that parents whose children are in homeschooling programs share. Hearts, a homeschooling program ran through Generic_City and all over the east coast, has a much larger graduation rate in students and higher averaged grades than public schools in the same areas. Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students. With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. All of this information supports the idea that learning at home is a working solution that the government should endorse and improve within their schools. The second reason that online classing would be a good idea is the ability to allow students to study specifically hard material. Majority of current online classing has a system that allows teachers to record or stream lectures that explain the material. Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory. With this, students can make sure that they received and understood all of the content that they need to know for the classes that they are taking. Finally, online classing would give students the opportunity to learn valuable time management skills. Along with having control over setting, students would be given control over how they use their time. Homeschooled students often have a lot of time to allocate for school and other activities. This is essential for every student to understand and master, as they will have the same choices when they grow into adults. Students who have other obligations outside of school will be allowed to modify their learning time each day, as well as take breaks from work as needed. Many people argue that students can abuse this opportunity as to skip learning altogether, and allow them to grow bad habits. The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well being later in life. The largest flaw that has been located is this some students benefit more from learning in person rather than online. The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. Yes, online classes are meant to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging topics and units, and build proper time management skills. Throughout this article, evidence has been placed that support all three of these factors. Learning at home gives the students the ability to be taught in more comfortable environments rather than the common classroom. The ability to relearn lectures and other class materials allow students to master the topics given to them. Time management skills can be learned, as the students are given control over the ability to use their time in ways that they think is best. Even some of the common flaws of online classing has been addressed and solved. The ability to change the way we learn is something that I believe is essential to allow minds to reach their highest potential. No one learns the same way as the person next to them. That is why if people are starved of the choice to learn the way that they want, then us as a country will not be able to grow along with the rest of the world. If this method is amplified and improved, then America can become one of the most educated countries on earth.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear Mr. Senator, The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, states the article What Is the Electoral College? written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electors vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an elector of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that elector will go back on his word and vote for another cadidate. The article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer states, The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer states, In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way. This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College. Aside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, What Is the Electoral College? written by the Office of the Federal Register states, Most states have a 'winnertakeall' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit swing states. Swing states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer says, During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid out defenses of the system are wrong states, Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, The Indefesible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid out defenses are wrong written by Bradford Plumer states, It's officual The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right Abolish the electoral college!\n",

      "Error processing text: Oh my god! yelled Generic_Name in frustration. What Generic_Name? questioned her mother in confusion.I have no clue what college to go to, this is a big decision and i don't want to mess it up. Generic_Name responded stressed. Go to the college i went to, George Mason. It is totally great, it has 24 hour food places on campus, nice people, and plenty of stores near it. You would love it there. Replied her mom.Ugh mom! That wasn't helpful because I have no clue where to go, and those where all bias, and now I don't know what to believe. I need more opinions. Asking more than one person is a very helpful, and good idea because it will help you receive valid advice, advice that isn't bias, and advice from people who truly want the best and wont sabotage you. If you ask many people for advice, you will get many different answers. First off, some of the advice a person may receive can be based upon true facts, that the person giving advice has discovered. While on the other hand, others will give you opinionated advice, based upon what they believe, and with no prior knowledge. This can result in you thinking something is true and very good your whole life, just to come to find out it is not. For example, my sister,Generic_Name, is an allstar cheerleader who is very skilled and has tons of knowledge when it comes to cheer leading, but this wasn't the case when she started out. She had no clue what cheer shoes to get, and what the difference from a cheer shoe, and a regular shoe was. She asked our mom, who said just get any shoe, it won't really matter, but Generic_Name waited to find out more information. She went to her first day of practice and asked around, her teammates and coaches knew she was flexible and tiny, so they knew she would be a flyer. Some people recommended shoes meant for tumbling, because they knew it would make it harder for her to fly and that they could replace her, which was totally rude and invalid advice, but most people recommended a shoe from a brand named Infinity. The shoes name was Flyte, a cheer shoe meant for flyers, She got the shoe, and it helped her immensely. This is one example as to why asking many people will help you receive better information. Another time, Generic_Name, my moms friend, was trying to go to a beach for vacation. My mom told her to go to the outer banks, because thats what she would choose. Generic_Name asked around throughout the neighbor hood, and found out that most people like Sandbridge, so thats where she booked her vacation. When she got there it was packed to the brim with people and umbrellas, smelled like smoke, and the sand was contaminated with burnt, gross cigarette buds, and litter. She realized that everyone she asked had not really been to the beach much, and actually went other places. This is another example as to why people should make sure to ask people who you trust, but ask more than one. Secondly, advice given can be totally untrue, and bias. For example, when Generic_Name, my oldest sister, was trying to find a hotel she asked her one friend, who had visited the area before. Her friend told her you got to an Inn Called Holiday Inn. Generic_Name trusted her friends advice and went to the Holiday Inn. It ended up being terrible. It smelled bad, was moldy, and had no wifi. When Generic_Name got back she asked her friend why she would do that. Her friend said that her dad was the owner of the hotel and that she just wanted her dad to have an extra customer, which was completely bis. Generic_Name never trusted her advice again. This is another reason why you can't always trust everyone. Sometimes their advice is completely bias. Another time this happened was when Generic_Name, Generic_Names twin, was applying for college. He asked his guidance counselor what college she recommended, she said James Madison. He had no clue where to go and hadn't looked for places with his intended major. He went to James Madison, and tried to major in IT, ad they didn't have an IT program. He had to switch his major to psychology, and went back to ask why she recommended that school, knowing he was majoring in IT. She said she had no clue if it had IT or not but that she went there. He was really mad at his counselor, and never asked just one person again, knowing it could be a completely bias opinion. Lastly, asking advice from people who arent trying to beat you in something, or who truly want the best for you is a vary good thing. Generic_Name, my friend, is a dancer, and in dance if you are competing, and a piece of clothing such as a hat, or a big piece of decoration on the out fit falls off, you will lose a lot of points and most likely lose the competition. When she was making her out fit for her Ariel themed dance, she asked her friend, also her top competitor, what to get to make bubble, and what fabric to use. Hey friend recommended a fabric that ripped easily, and a plastic to use for bubbles, which was really heavy, and would shatter it dropped. In Generic_Names dance, her shirt ripped on the shoulder, where the bubble where, in the middle of a twisty jump. The bubbles came crashing down, splattering all over that place after breaking into a bunch of fragments. She was disqualified, and her friend won the competition. Another time, my mom asked her friend how to make brownies, for the baking competition. Our neighbor really wanted to win and gave her a recipe that had lemon extract and baking soda, rather than vanilla extract, and baking powder. My mom ended up coming in last place. This is why it is a good idea to make sure your not asking advice from competitors. In conclusion it is very important to ask many people, In doing so, you will receive advice from many people, and and there is a better chance of there being someone more educated on the advice sought, nonbias information, and someone with nonsabotaged information. Therefor, the information you receive isn't from just one person, who may not be well educated, who may be bias, and who may not truly want the best in you.\n",

      "Error processing text: Imagine you are waking up on your first day of school, only to turn around and grab your computer to begin your lesson for the week. For some, this is a reality, in areas where schools are becoming more open to the idea of distance learning, or off campus learning. However, going to school and gaining first hand experience with all different types of people is the easiest way for young people to be exposed to diversity, and to engage in interactive educational activities. School provides many opportunities for young people that an online program simply cannot do. Even video conferences, are limited in providing a real school adaptation. In my opinion, students are being held back more than progressing from online courses. Distance classes take away the human interaction of school, and hold students back from personal growth thus, it should only be an option for special cases. From the moment you are placed in school, you are constantly adapting to new environments, classes, and people. School is one of the easiest ways for a young person to find friends or people that they can trust and rely on. Some students need these social interactions to help show them that not everyone is similar, opening their eyes to diverse ideas, cultures, and ways of life. Having all of your courses online is isolating and can lead students down a path of lonliness, since they will be missing out on all of the humaninteraction that going to a regular school provides. Students need a support system for them to count on, which may be found at school, if they do not feel safe and loved at home. In most cases, middle and high schools provide in depth science lab activities, math modeling activties, interactive games, field trips, and group projects. These activities bring students together in a way that only a personal experience can. Having to work together in small groups helps students understand one another and also helps them look at concepts through different perspectives. Virtual activties never leave as strong of an impact on the student as handson actvities do, or give them experience with other students. Overall, online schooling only decreases a persons social skills and promotes isolation. As I said before, students have lost that student to student relationsip when learning all alone, but also they lose the student to teacher relationship. There are teachers that have such a lasting impact on students and they may not even realize it, they may be looked at as a mentor, an inspiration, or even a friend in certain situations. Having a module instructor is not neccesarily having a human connection we can all watch videos of a teacher online and feel no personal connection to the person behind the screen. Tecahers are able to provoke in depth thinking and analysis from students, from personal experience and seeing how their students learn best. Some students may learn visually, through song, or maybe through repititon, this simple fact goes to show another reason online courses are not beneficial to all students. Everyone has a unique way of learning, an online course or a video conference may not be able to provide the same accomodations for a student that a one on one studentteacher relationship would. Students should be exposed to all learning types to see which ways are easiest for them, instead of being forced to overwork trying to figure a problem out without aid. Although, in some cases, I do believe there should be an online alternative to the average school. Students that have had an injury and may be unable to attend school for medical reasons, should be given the opportunity to study and learn outside of the school building. There may be cases where a student with special needs is not ready to be placed into a super social setting, and I do agree that they should be given the option of an online schooling program to best fit them and their needs. The argument could be made that online, isolated courses would prevent bullying and provide students with a more comfortable learning environment. I refute this point, by stating that to learn and grow we must be placed outside of our comfort zones and forced to experience new things that we typically could not at home. We cannot grow in a stagnant environment. Looking at a computer screen every day, is not the best way to stimulate young minds, they must be provided with experiences that they can learn from first handedly. In conclusion, I am not in favor of students taking courses online as a substitute for going to school. The school building is like a network of support for each and every student who eneters. Teachers try their hardest to accomodate to every student and provide them with the extra help they need, or help them gain independence and confidence. An online program is in no way going to care about the mental health of the students or give them an extra uplift when they are struggling. In other words, distance learning should only be provided for students with special accomadations, otherwise you are taking away the opportunity for interaction and student self growth. When considering offering classes from home, we need to remember that we are building the future generation. Do we really want to raise a group of young individuals that can only function in isolated environments because they have not been exposed to human interaction?\n",

      "Error processing text: School today went by as slow as a snail, but as soon as I took the last step off my bus home, I raced down my street to see the answer I had been waiting for the whole day If I made it into the Spanish Immersion Specialty center or not. The thrill of the answer made my legs move even faster, so fast that I bolted into the house as quick as lightning, and straight to the kitchen counter where the taunting envelope had been sitting. My family joined me to see what would be revealed inside the envelope as I carefully removed the paper that had been surrounding the letter. I got in! I happily shouted. All of that worrying was for nothing. But eventually, my brother came up to me, and asked,You're not actually going to do the Spanish Immersion program, are you? I was confused. I didn't realize his opinion on the program was really different from mine. Why wouldn't I? I responded. I don't know, it just seems kind of dumb to me. Also you have to take math in Spanish, and it's already hard enough in English. If I were you I wouldn't do it. he told me. He began to walk away, as I wondered Is this the best thing for me? Maybe he's right. I guess I was all excited just to be in the program that I didn't realize all the challenges I would have to face. I thought to myself. My Mom made the program seem like a walk in the park, but now by brother is saying it's going to be more difficult than that, which has really changed my opinion about the program. I now think that receiving advice from different people is important because different people are going to have different points of views of the topic, asking only one person might not give me the right advice, and I think the more advice people give me the more strongly I can be sure of a future decision. First off, I think receiving advice from multiple people is important because everyone is going to have different points of views on the same topic. I would like to start off by saying that no one is the same, therefore receiving as much advice as I can from multiple types of people is going to be more beneficial for my decision than to just hear it from only one person. Plus, their reasoning of why I should or shouldn't say yes to this decision might be not as good as some other reasons I could receive. No one's advice is going to be completely perfect, but it's best to hear from them to see what they think the wise decision would be. Also, no one has the same experiences, so while one person may believe this because of their experiences, another could think the completely opposite because of what they have been through. All I'm saying is many people believe in different things and that is okay because as humans, we are all different from one another. Secondly, I believe asking more people for advice is the more beneficial thing to do because asking one person may not give me the advice I need. For instance, if I had just asked my mom about the Spanish Immersion program, she would obviously encourage me to go because she doesn't know what it's actually going to be like, but my brother on the other hand, speaks from a regular high school student's perspective and is telling me I shouldn't go. Both of their advice helps me see the pros and cons of the program. If I had only asked one of them, I would only see the pros, or I would only see the cons. Asking one person is a mistake because I will only see their perspective, which their perspective may not be right for someone. They're are many people out in the world who can help out with advice, so don't be afraid to ask! Lastly, I think it is important to seek out more advice from people because it can help a person be sure of the decision they're going to choose. Making certain choices can be really difficult and confusing at times, but having people there helping me out with this decision is the greatest gift somebody could ask for. Their help with my decision makes me see the different parts of the program, which helps make the best choice for me. Advice is extremely important because it has a big factor in decision making. Hearing about someone's past experiences with a job, or a certain company can really help put a decision in perspective. If I ever need help with another big choice, I'll be making sure to ask for advice again because receiving opinions on a certain subject can really be substantial for a choice. To sum everything up, seeking out opinions from other people can really influence our choices in a good way. That's why I think receiving advice from different people is important because everyone has different points of view on a topic, asking only one person may not give me the advice I need, and the more advice people give me the more I can be sure of a choice I make. Big decisions can be hard to make. Asking people for thier input on what they think I should do should never be a scary thing to do in fact, I think being asked for advice in general would make the person being asked feel proud because someone is coming to them for help. In the future, the best way to make a certain choice is to base it around other's advice.\n",

      "Error processing text: Cars have been by all means the number one way of transportation in the last decade and now people are starting to prefer walking or biking instead of driving everywhere. One of the reasons is pollution people all around the world are scared of the greenhouse effect but peole are moslty looking at the advantages in not driving If we dont drive the earth will be less polluted in the united states the number two cause in pollution is cars if we cut our driving in half we would be making our earth less polluted and more clean and also saving our ozone layer another reason that not driving isnt such a nad thing is you dont have to deal with the gas money everyone spends on there car well if you want to drive you have to put gas in it so it can go and sometimes the gas prices can be up there an if i gave my estimate i think people spend close 20,000 dollars in gas if your driving in your community of course im not talking about every person in the world just giving an estimate and that is alot of money if you save that much money in about 4 years you have your self a house or an apratment its a big difference spending all that money on gas then saving up for something you really want like a house apartment etc something else you dont have to deal with is the traffic that cars cause on the higway and sometimes in the community i know we all have been stuck in a horrible traffic jam and you cant do anything about it and we all think if only we could just walk ny everybody well the people that arnet driving and they are on the sidewalk yeah they can walk past it or they dont have to deal with the traffic jam another reason is a the accidents sometimes can be fatal to life and your checkbook and insurance now a days is through the roof another thing you have to worry about paying when your dealing with a car accidents take alot of lives every year i read a stat that every second there are three acidents i mean i dont know if its true but if it is that is flat out scary of course you never think it will happen to you but even the best drivers crash and when it does happen either your life is in danger or checkbook is thats another thing walkers and bikers dont have to worry about crashing and either being seriously injured or coughing thousnads of dollars of expensies or damages also have to worry about keeping your car in the shop every time you need an oil change or your tires are flat or transmisson isnt working right there can be a millon problems with your car and that all cost money waling to your destantion doesnt cost a cent and if your the person that likes to save every cent why throw it away when you throwing thousands and thousands of dollars every year on something youn quite francally dont need in your life if your destnation is to walk take the bus close enough so you can walk there that way you will be saving so much money that you'l be amazed at the end of the year when you have way more money than you had last year your going to look back and say wow i should never got a car so always keep in mind the next time you step in your car the worries you deal with every time you drive remember ypu have to fill up or your not going any where and always going to hurt your checkbook espiacally if your car gets 10 per a gallon another thing is the scare of the accident always looming in the dark you never know when you'll have but almost everyone is doomed to have one and those can be fatal to your body or checkbook and insureance for when it does happen is not pretty also those traffic jams are horrible and when you say aabout 50 peole all past you on the side walk and your stuck in that massive traffic jam you'll remeber this essay and say wow i should of been on that side walk and the last advantge you should know about is that while your not driving your not hurting everyones earth world air space etc your helping the earth get cleaner everytime you decide to walk instead pump up your gas tank and let off polluted gas off into the air and ulitamelty deplete the ozone i know that people will still be driving because again like i said its the number one way of transportation but the goal should be to atleast cut the driving rate in half that would help the earth in a major way and of course you would be alot richer by the end of the year so all that walking you did over the year you can rechoice over a nice vaction to the bahmamas or hawaii oe even buy yourself a nice house so you can see that dropping your car should of been a decison you did years ago and the earth will be a better place without your car driving around the streets so the next time your friend asks to come over just walk or the next time you need to just go get the groroices you can walk and one by one peole will stop driving and start helping making the earth a better cleaner safer place so you be the first one to drop driving and start walking and people will follow imsure of it and even if you have to explain the benfits so beit just know by doing those things you will acheive the goal of making the earth a better place without pollution and more ozone layer to protect from the dangerous uv light if you want a better future for your kid or grandchild its just not your earth your hurting its everybody else's including your loved ones all that money your spending buy your loved ones a gift.\n",

      "Error processing text: Alright class now here is where you need to pay attention..., and the screen goes black, not to mention the only thing written in big, bold letters is the word Rebooting, planted right in the center of your once lit up screen. Online classes seem like fun at first, you get to stay home, relax and work at your own pace, until they're not. In fact online classes can bring many issues that can not only affect you majorly in the academic world but also in your mental world. The idea that students can benefit more from taking at home classes is invalid due to students being at a bigger disadvantage than those at school and the fact that online classes can lead to overall mental health issues. Although students taking classes at home are in a more comfortable environment than those at school, they're continuously put at a disadvantage from those who are able to receive more help at school. As understanding as it is, wanting to be in a comfortable position while tons of different information is shoved inside your brain, online students find themselves struggling to understand what is being taught to them at least 50 of the time. While students located in schools have the opportunity to ask for assistance in any subject needed by teachers, those at home are not as lucky to have teachers at home who take the time to slowly break down information for students until it fits their understanding. Struggles in comprehending subjects leads to overall, no further progress for online students who than must try and catch up to those already a subject ahead of them. Another disadvantage for students at home is the fact that they dont receive as much mental support as those in schools. For example, teachers motivate students to complete work continuously, or to do well in classes and tests all the time students at home don't receive that support which means they dont feel motivated enough to pass tests or complete work, which than leads to failing grades and failure to turn in work. In my school my English teacher tells us a phrase that not only motivates me everyday, but encourages the idea that its okay to fail because you just have fight harder to pass in the next attempt. Or as she says, the first step of passing is to fail, thats the type of motivation that kids at home need. Though staying home while receiving an education sounds fantastic, understanding that a student will always be at a disadvantage from those at school is not, because wanting to be comfortable is not a good enough reason for falling behind. Additionally, students taking at home classes can also be at risk of suffering through many mental health issues in the future. Normally, when a student struggles to comprehend materials they tend to get very frustrated with not only themselves but with everything around them. Later on those frustrations turn into big ball of stress. The Stress of falling behind, stress of trying to catch up, and finally, stress of not being able to understand. Eventually, that frustration and that stress, just keep building up until, one day, one just can't take it anymore,and they pop. While being in that terrible phase the anxiety monster finds that moment of weakness as an opportunity and decides to take over the students subconscious, all because at home students, as previously stated, have harder times comprehending subjects than those at school. So, we have anxiety, we got frustration, and we have some stress going around,that should be it right? Wrong, because theres is one more mental health issue that at home students are at risk of getting that not only controls a small part of the body but at least the majority of it. Ladies and gentleman, please welcome Mr. Depression to the list of mental health issues to the table. Although depression seems unlikely for students at school to get, it is actually very possible for those students at home to obtain. In school many students go through many interactions daily whether it be talking to friends at lunch, or talking to a teacher for help, even talking to the principle when your in trouble is a daily interaction that school students go through. on the other hand, students at home dont have many interactions daily as those in school, they dont have friends to sit with at lunch or teachers to help them with work or even a principle to yell at them when they break dress code, it's just them. Eventually they will start feeling that emotion of isolation and once its there it wont go away, than that feeling of being alone well become permanent and the depression beings. Overall students at home are at bigger risk of going through many mental health issues than those in school. However, objectors may argue that at home education encourages students to take on, and later gain, more responsibility. At home education allows students to do work at their own pace, but the student must be responsible enough to work as hard as ever to make progress. Another way students at home have more responsibility is because, if they dont understand subjects fully, it is up to them and only them to look up additional information to help them get that full comprehension. Additionally, they must stay on top of classes and work by their own will, because nobody will be there to push them to do their work besides themselves. Although at home classes can bring upon many issues for a student. they do have the opportunity to gain much responsibility, and eventually, mature. In conclusion online classes may seem like a good idea at first, but can later be the worst decision you could ever make. online classes bring many disadvantages towards students both phiscally and mentally. They also bring on many mental health issues like stress and depression. Overall, the idea that students benefit more from taking online classes is false because, they bring students to a bigger disadvantage and the affect scholars with many mental health issues in later life.\n",

      "Error processing text: Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new. Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new. Theres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 23 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety. Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends. My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.\n",

      "Error processing text: Generic_Name and Generic_Name are on their way to the pet store in seek of a household pet that can accompany them. They want to get a dog, but don't know how to take care of one. How should we find information about taking care of a dog? Generic_Name said with tear filled eyes. I don't know but we should ask around the pet store for help. Generic_Name said. Generic_Name looked at him in confusion and said, Why don't we just ask the person who works in the dog department? Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name with a wide grin and explained, It's better to ask more than one person when getting information because everyone has a different view on dogs and how to take care of them. Generic_Name then understood as they walked around the store asking different store employees about what they need and what they need to do to take care of a dog. Not everyone's opinion or advice is valid or important in certain circumstances. This means just asking a singular individual on a topic might not be the best choice or even give you the best advice. People should seek and ask multiple sources on advice because they get clearer information, see different view points, and get more feedback. First off, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get clearer information on a topic. For example, I went to a website to search for how to stay calm when your stressed. It didn't give me a clear answer so I searched up another site. This one told me exact steps and procedures on how to calm yourself in a stressful situation. It gave me a better understanding on why looking at multiple sources can give someone better and clearer information. In addition, when my sister needed help at swim practice, she asked multiple people on her swim team how to do a certain stride instead of asking just one person. This helped her see an arrangement of different techniques that gave her different perspectives on how to do the one stride correctly. Later, she went up to her coach and asked her for clarification on how to do the move as well. This helped her choose whether she needed to practice her stride more or just to improve on little alterations. This leads into the next topic on how different view points can help someone make a better choice. Next, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can see from different view points. For example, I looked at reviews on a product before buying it to see what other people's opinions on the product were. If I were just to have bought the product without reading whether it would work or not, it could result in me losing my money and having a useless product. Seeing other peoples different views and opinions can alter my own opinion and lead me to a better choice in a product to pick from. Additionally, my dad, when he was picking out a cat from a shelter, took into great consideration of the advice the workers gave him on what he needed to take care of a cat and how. However, he also asked around with people in the cat owner community who helped him out as well. The different view points that the shelter and the cat owner community had were vital in the way that gave him the proper tools and techniques to use when taking care of a cat. This leads to the final example on how asking for advice from multiple people can give someone more feedback which helps them in making a choice. Finally, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get more feedback. Furthermore, my cousin plays the trumpet at a professional level and most of the time needs feedback on his performances to see how he did. After his shows, he usually asks some audience members how he preformed and if he could improve in someway what could he improve on. It really helps him see what he needs to do better on by asking multiple people, rather than just asking a singular trumpeter in his band. It also helps him decide if he needs to practice more or if he sounded amazing and preformed at the best of his ability. As well as, when I record a video of me playing my instrument I ask more than one person for feedback. I email my band instructor on how I did and on how I can improve for later performances. I then ask my mom and dad on how I did by playing the video for them and ask if they heard that I sounded squeaky, or if I need to redo my video because the sound quality is low as well as other things. The more feedback I have on how I did, the better of chances I have improving my playing skills along the way. Generic_Name and Generic_Name walk out of the pet store with nothing more than a dog and the essentials for owning one. They both give each other a wide smile and a sigh of relief as they walk home with their new family member. Thanks for asking around on how to care for Fluffy, who Generic_Name had named. It was way better than just asking one person for everything we needed! Generic_Name looked at her again with a stern face, Now you know the important's of not just asking one person for advice, but for asking multiple people to see their opinions and options on certain topics. Just because they don't have an answer doesn't mean that no one does. Generic_Name looks at him with a gloomy face and apologizes for her misunderstanding. Feedback from others will also help us change and better our understanding on how to take care of our dog. As they continue to walk home, they both realize that not everyone's advice is good and not everyone is bad. But asking multiple people for help does give you a better understanding than just one straight forward answer. Some people's opinions in some situations won't help you in making a better decision. In conclusion, people should seek and ask multiple sources on advice because you get clearer information, see different view points, and get more feedback.\n",

      "Error processing text: Vroom, vroom goes the 1998 Chevy Impala next to you at the stop light. Driving has become apart of culture that is standard to the developed world. But the culture is slowly changing because the driving epidemic is becoming limited. Cars can be very expensive, harmful to the environment, and troublesome. Limiting car usage can help the environment, help finances, and reduce stress. Cars are defined as metal cases with leather seats powered by gas or diseal. Gas and diesel are fuels that are harmful to the Earth and can cause harmful emission and greenhouse gases. These gasses can cause smog, or smoke and fog mixed together creating a grey cloud of unbreathable dense air. Smog is very harmful for the environment and can heat the Earth which is not the ideal for the human body. In France, smog, caused by car emissions became unbearable, thus causing the entire city of Paris to ban cars for five days. According to Robert Duffer, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog Paris Bans Driving due to Smog Paragraph 14. Therefore cars and its horrible blow can cause a blanket of harmful reactant. Cars can also cause greenhouse gases which is when the heat of the day and the cool of the night trap in the harmful emissions of a car. These greenhouse gases can also heat the Earth and can harm humans. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States CarFree Cities Paragraph 5. In effort to save the Earth and the human race many cities and communities have adopted carbanning, reducing the amount of population caused buy cars. A 2014 Lincoln MKX runs about 45,000, which is the equivalent to the salary of a high school teacher annually. Cars can be very expensive to buy, maintain, and to fuel. The price of oil is about 2.45 today. But over the past few years gas prices have fluctuated up to almost 4.00 a gallon. The average driver might buy gas every two weeks at 20 gallons, that equals 116 a month for gas. The money used to fuel the car has turned into a gas bill, not to mention the sparatic mishaps that can happen while on the road. Cars today have become an investment instead of a luxury. Although, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, does not mean it should remain. The advance in technology and resources has allowed people to reduce the use of cars, and ultimately save themselves money. For example, many people have coworkers that live near one another. Thus, both persons can carpool on alternate days. Mimi Sheller suggests, the Internet makes telecommunting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends End of Car Culture Paragraph 35. It is much easier and cheaper to carpool, take the bus, or take the subway. Limiting car usage would save money because more young people are interestedin driving, but it's not a prority. Therefore, parents do not have to spend 30,000 on a new car for their 16 year old. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, which is putting money back into the pockets of parents and public transportation companies The End of Car Culture Paragraph 39. Road rage is the disease the that overtakes a person when another person is driving idiotically. Road rage is sitting at a green light at a complete stop because the person in front of you is too busy texting their BFF. Road rage is caused by driving. Driving can cause stress because cars are out of your control, traffic is out of your control, and time is out your control. When things are out of control, human nature is to panic. Driving is not the time nor the place to panic. Limiting car usage can reduce the effects of this stress caused by driving because there would be less people on the road, less traffic, and less crashes. Heidrun Walter says, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way Car Free Cities Paragraph 3. Less cars means less drivers which then means a safer environment for pedestrians. Less cars means less traffic which means no more road rage. Less cars means less cars because there are less reckless drivers grazing the road. Limiting car usage can also make people come closer together because it forces them to interact in order to get around. For instance, instead of hopping into you 2013 Camry you call an old friend who happens to work on a different floor of your office building. This interaction can spark a new realtionship and brightens your day. Cars and driving causes stress because it is out of control, but if cars are limited then the stressed caused by driving will be reduced. Road rage, smog, and tickets, driving is the mush pot of the many problems of this world. Limiting car usage can save the planet, save money, and save you blood from boiling. The priviledge of driving has been taken advantage of and has caused the world to decay at its own expense. The human race has the ability remit from the tragdey of cars one city at a time.\n",

      "Error processing text: In the generation we are living in today cars are a huge part of our everyday lives. Whether it's going to schoolwork, hanging with friends or anywhere really people rely on their cars for everything and you never hear anyone talk about walking, biking and taking another way of transportation. It's whole new era with how are society is created and working but it's how we are living, and it seems to be working. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky all have the same mindset when talking about cars while each are talking about a different reason to decrease car usage, they all have a common interest in wanting it to be implied or simply like how it is being enforced. So after reading very specific, factual, and information articles I now know the advantages of limiting car usage and that is to save time and businesses, conserve resources, and having a vast decrease in car culture. Imagine yourself on a bad morning, you woke you late and you're probably rushing out the door for work, and as a fellow American I would know that there is early morning traffic no matter where you are headed. But if you didn't use a car and maybe walked or rode a bike you could easily get there faster if it was a reasonable distance. In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets fo this capital city eerily to devoid of traffic jams Selsky, par 20. This goes to show that when people took other steps to get to work instead of cars that there was no traffic jams. Which means no waitng which also means getting to work at a normal time, or for some, even on time. When you think about it you know that the roads can be a really busy and hetic place to be if you time it just right, so if you take the extra measure and maybe walk home you can easily make faster time and not just that but it helps the environment. Now another advantage of not using cars is businesses start to flourish. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Selsky, par 28. Since many people have decided not to use their cars they walk or bike and that can lead to going to places near by which would mean they see more of their city than they did in a car. More eyes are to catch businesses and they find themselves walking into a store because they aren't rushed andor it might just look intersting which is a huge benefit for companies. Secondly, another advantage on limiting car usage would be conserving resources. This is a very major step when it comes to the environment and things like these should be enforced for a greener Earth. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Rosenthal, par 5. This is damaging our Earth and the only to prevent it is to limit your car use. Because how it's happening and how it's polluting our Earth is from the cars tailpipes when it releases the exhaust. Due to this hazardly problem laws are starting to be made to limit the use. Towns and cities have tried to come up with a nodriving day to decrease the use and help the environment, and in many cases it has worked while in some, it hasn't. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Duffer, par 10. In effect to this 'experiment' it is shown that this way of thinking had changed Paris pollution decreased and congestion in traffic was down and the smog that was being created by cars had stopped the next couple of days. It's unbelievable to know what can happen when you limit yourself. Finally, it is clear that there is a decrease in car culture. There have been recent studies that imply that more Americans aren't driving or just plain out don't want to get their licenses. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009... Rosenthal, par 41. We aren't really understanding as to why this is happening. Maybe it's because they are afraid of getting a ticket, their parents haven't allowed it, they are against pollution it's not known. But what we do know is that yes, it's saving the environment but it's hurting the car businesses. If the pattern presists and many sociologists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants Rosenthal, par 34. Yes, this is going to increasingly better our enivornment by not having more cars on the road to pollute, but it will for sure hurt the car industry. Not many people even have the money to go out a buy a car in this economy. And from the car businesses in ruins, some are even rebranding themselves. The change in car culture is known for much less commuting due to technology as well. Lastly, a reminder of the advantages in limiting car usage are saving time and businesses, conserving resources and a decrease in car culture. So when you're on the road, start thinking about ways to stop your use of cars and see how it would benefit the environment cause the more we drive around the worse our Earth will become.\n",

      "Error processing text: Phones and Driving Although Cell Phones are pretty useful it does not mean that people should be glued on to it the whole time. They may help connect one another, but at some points, the phone has to be put down. Such as when someone is doing tasks that need them to be focused. For example, driving needs the person driving to be all the way focused. Although most people may tend to use their phones for a GPS system most cars in this modern day have a GPS system within it. Phones should not be used in driving because of less attention on the road, setting a bad example for young children, and it is worse than driving under the influence. First of all, cell phones are a Manual distraction. This means that the tasks that require the driver to take a hand off the steering wheel and manipulate a device. Hilbert 24 Due to this, the driver is more distracted and unsafe when driving. According to the text This inventory highlighted aspects of equipment designs that could affect driver distraction.Hilbert 30 This means that the driver would spend more time looking at a screen than on the road. As stated by the author, Cellular phones, and other invehicle distractions, force drivers to divide their limited attentional resources among tasks, thereby focusing less of their attention on driving. Delashmit 160 Phones may still be useful for people but less time looking at the road is still not a good thing and could set a bad example for younger children. Secondly, children have a developing mind. Meaning that certain events may scar them for life. They may even think that it is okay to be on the phone. As it states in the text For example, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in collaboration with NHTSA, found that driver inattention was involved in 80 percent of all vehicle crashes 65 percent of nearcrashes. Delashmit 150 If a parent or older sibling, while a child is in a car, is on the phone when driving then they are more likely to be distracted from the road and crash. The younger people are trusting the person who is driving and if there were to be an accident then it could start the development to a mental health disorder. As stated by the author These implications highlight the degree to which a child or adolescent is likely to be involved, witness or experience a crash or the consequences of a crash and therefore be subjected to any number of physical injuries or psychological disorders.Greydanus 92 If it was not bad enough driving under the influence is a little like worse then spending eighty percent of the time on the phone while driving. Finally, although driving under the influence is bad, it is still not worse then spending more time looking on the phone then on the road. As stated in the text The public does not appear to be as cognizant of this social responsibility aspect, as distinct from personal risk, for invehicle technology use, compared to alcohol.Hilbert 153 This meaning that driving under the influence is not as bad as being on the phone. A test was conducted to see how drivers would drive under the influence or on the phone. The results where Some studies of cell phone use have compared the degradation of performance to some level of alcohol impairment. Strayer, Drews, Crouch 2006, for example, found in a study of simulated driving that drivers using cell phones had elevated crash risks similar to those of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of approximately .08 gdL, though the specific impairments of each group differed. This test showed that there were more accidents with being on the phone than driving under the influence. Although some may say that having the phone out is okay seeing as it is used for navigation. There are laws in place for driving and having a cellular device. As stated by the text These laws take several forms Some require drivers to use a handsfree device if they want to talk on the phone, some prohibit younger or less experienced drivers from using any type of cell phone, and some allow officers to cite drivers for using a handheld cell phone if the driver is pulled over for another offense.Guerin 163 As shown they only get in trouble or is only bad if they have it in their hand only if they get pulled over and the officer sees it in their hand. Driving while on the phone is not bad. In conclusion, phones and driving is not that good. It puts the risk of lives on the line. It causes more vehicle accidents on the road than any other distraction. Although it maybe be handy to help navigate it still should not be used eighty percent of the time while on the road. It sets a bad example for children. It is still slightly worse then driving under the influence. Driving and having a phone out is bad. Works Cited Page Delashmit, Geraud, and Henri Bedard.

      "Error processing text: Driverless cars are the future of driving. It is an inevitable fact, people are already spending countless hours trying to figure out how to make cars safe and driverless, and have made some cars that are nearly driverless. I think that driverless cars are a bad idea. These cars will just help fuel americas lazy lifestyle. Having cars the drive themselves will take all of the fun out of driving. I think that driving is a lot of fun and if we take away peoples ability to drive then we will miss out on a lot of fun and skills that can help in everyday life. Automatic cars are not safe, if there is an accident on the road or constuction or anything blocking the road then the automatic cars will need the assistance of human drivers. The cars that are being produced now are not even fully automatic. There are some car manufactoring companies that have already made cars that are almost driverless and have been working on making driverless cars for years and years. Some of these companies include General Motors, google using a Toyota Prius, BMW, Tesla, Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan have all either come out with a car that is almost driverless or has released plans to release them, Tesla in 2016 and the others in 2020. These manufacturing companies have already started making automatic cars and have been working on them for a very long time. I think that if the companies keep working and progressing on the safety issues with the automatic vehicles then maybe these automatic cars can be a good thing. The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others howeveer might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered. When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to dissappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Diving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in every day life and even at work. Driving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remeber forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories. Automatic cars will not be safe. These automatic cars can not handle anything besides normal road conditions or even pulling in and out of driveways. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents Driverless cars are coming, author unknown. These cars have been built to alert the driver when they need to take over the vehicle, but are still not capable of functioning without a human driver, which could be a safety hazards. If the vehicle is not able to handle the road conditions ahead it will attemp to notify the driver inside, but considering it is an automatic vehicle the driver may have fallen asleep due to the lack of entertainment of activities to keep them alert and then the car nor the driver is able to manuver the obsticles ahead and the could cause an accident resluting in the death of anyone involved. Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic.\n",

      "Error processing text: Some schools offer distance learning as an option from home by way of online or video conferencing. Allowing students to have an alternative option to distance learning is beneficial in many ways. Not only does it allow students to learn in a familiar friendly environment, it also allows them to form and adjust to their own schedule, and develop better sleeping habits and a healthy lifestyle. Offering distance learning as an option for students allows them to learn in a familiar, safe, and amble environment. This can benefit students with issues in mental or physical health. It can also benefit students who want to experience learning outside of a traditional classroom. For example, Generic_Name, a third year high school student, has gone to public school for the majority of her school life. She has decided to take classes online at home for one year just to gain the experience. At home, Generic_Name feels like she is able to learn better because she is familiar with the atmosphere. Occasionally, she is able to go for a walk during her break which is something she wasn't able to do when she was in a regular classroom. Having her parents during the day, enables her to ask questions, discuss assignments, and other things they might want to discuss that day. Giving students an out of classroom learning experience allows them to gain better insight on the world around them, and gives solace and understanding of their atmosphere and surroundings. Similarly, Generic_Name is a fifth grader in primary school. His parents decided to enroll him in a video conferencing class with a oneonone teacher. Generic_Name suffers from ADHD which limits his performance in the classroom because of his short attention span. Having a oneone one teacher allows Generic_Name to feel safe in his own home which can help prevent distractions and outside noise often produced in a noisy classroom. Students deserve to feel safe in any learning environment they choose to be in. Giving students the opportunity to learn at home can give them a sense of security and assurance. Distance learning can also benefit students by giving them the opportunity to adjust to their own schedule. Students are occupied with numerous things outside assignments and tests. Allowing students to form their own schedule allows them to have time for sports, extracurricular activities, and selfcare. For example, Generic_Name is a high school student who is involved with the band, debate team, and track. Normal school hours often tire her out because of the fastpaced, nonstop hustle. She decides to take online classes so that she can alleviate some stress. Her online classes allow her to have time for her assignments, while also giving her spare time to practice basketball and attend her extracurricular activities. Similarly, Generic_Name is a middle school student who is involved with a lot of activities outside of school. For one semester, she decides to take video conference classes that would last for about an hour three times a day during the school week. She is able to schedule her events around the time she needs to appear for classes. Students are taught responsibility and good timemanagement skills when they are giving the ability to form and adjust their own schedule. Finally, another reason why distance learning can benefit students is it helps students develop a better lifestyle. Many students suffer from sleep deprivation and other health issues as a result of overworking and vigorous classroom expectations. Although working online doesn't deplete the consequences of overworking and challenging assignments, it gives students the ability to take breaks which can resolve burnout and mental stress. Generic_Name, a high school freshmen, is involved with basketball and hockey. He often comes home late at night after practice and games. When he arrives, he is flustered with the amount of homework and studying he still needs to complete. Often, he finds himself getting a minimum of four hours of sleep before he needs to wake up and go to school. Giving him the ability to take classes from home allows him to develop a sleep schedule and finish assignments on time without the stress of worrying about his other activities. In addition, Generic_Name is also a a high school student who is involved with the music program at her school. She often finds herself coming home late after rehearsals and barely has the time to complete her studying and assignments. She's anxious and stressed about her school work which slowly begins damaging her performance in school and her mental health. If Generic_Name decides to take online courses as an alternative, she will be able to fit in school work around her schedule and also maintain her time for her music program. For some students, learning at home can benefit them by altering their sleep habits, and improving their overall lifestyle and well being. While some may argue that distance learning by way of online or video conferencing doesn't benefit students, there are ways that it can help students improve their lifestyle and performance in their academics. Giving students the ability to attend school online can be beneficial to people with medical conditions that prohibit them from functioning in a regular classroom environment, can improve sense of responsibility, and can give students the ability to develop better liiving habits that can improve their overall well being.\n",

      "Error processing text: Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city andor regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a timeconsuming place. To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almostbroken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67 of cars in France, comparing to an average 57 of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe. Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semitrucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashesaccidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular. Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being the city that never sleeps, cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bikesharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridgetunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation. In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our numberone priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to it's the journey.\n",

      "Error processing text: WWIII My heart pounded in my ears so loudly to the point where I could not hear what my theatre director, Generic_Name, said next. After telling the cast that all Generic_City schools would be closed on Monday for the teachers to better prepare for potentially having to teach students at a distance due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, Generic_Name explained that there was a possibility we would sadly not be able to put on our spring play and the students might have to take online classes for a certain amount of time. In this day and age where technology dominates the world, a decent amount of schools worldwide are pushing for more online classes to be available. Students would not benefit from taking classes at home because there are many students who don't learn best through selfled classes and students would miss out on the classic interactive classroom experience. As many teachers learn through their personal studies and time spent in the classroom, there are many different types of learning styles that must be catered to in order to set a foundation for a student's success, therefore, teachers must be physically present if a student needs help. I remember when I was a freshman and my history teacher decided to not physically teach the class anymore because a group of students were making fun of his teaching style. All of our classwork was posted online and we had to direct ourselves through our lessons. When it came test time, my normally prominant A became a D after completely failing the exam. I was affected by the fact that I didn't comprehend what I thought I had learned over that past month and felt like my time had been wasted. I didn't learn anything by teaching myself because my job as a student should be to learn, not to do both. My sister, Generic_Name, shared a memory with me from elementary school that also exemplifies this where her 6th grade teacher had the students guide themselves through an online math unit. When Generic_Name was a confused about a problem and tried to ask a question, the teacher said that the questions had to be limited, as it was a selfdirected class. As an anxious 12 year old, this caused her not to do her best in school not only because the teacher wasn't allowed to answer her questions, but because she didn't digest what she learned through the technology. Elementary schoolers are not developed enough to take on directing themselves through their education. Frankly, elementary schoolers are not mature enough for that level of responsibility, and maturity is not something that can be taught online. Not only can disciplinary actions not be monitored, but also the energy that a classroom brings can not be recreated virtually through technology only through the good oldfashioned interactive environment. My friend, Generic_Name, is currently enrolled in two online courses History and English. I once told her that I had won a lollipop while playing a fun Kahoot game in English. She told me how much she misses playing Kahoots with a group of people. Online classes are meant to be rigorous, but they leave no room for students to have a break. Generic_Name mentions that she can find review games online, but when a whole classroom isn't competing against each other for a piece of candy it simply does not match that level of excitement. Classes are meant to push students and challenge them, but what many adults forget is that teens are people too and sometimes need an enticement to make learning fun, like the review game I played in geosystems. These games can not be experienced the same way virtually as opposed to a classroom. In my U.S. History class this year, we have switched back and forth each unit between writing a DBQ essay and having a socratic seminar. I have found it more beneficial to do a socratic seminar because I love feeding off of what other people have to say about the challenging topics we discuss and I found that I learn more from my peers than from the research we have to do for our DBQ essays. The online classes do not have a socratic seminar option because there has to be other students present to perform one. Learning from others, especially one's peers, is something that carries into the real world through jobs, relationships, and even in electing government officials. Human interaction is fundamental to one's growth, and online classes do not cater to that. While online classes do have their drawbacks, they also have their perks. Some say that online classes make it so that students can work around their own schedule. It is true that students can work at their own time and speed through online classes, but being physically in a classroom provides more structure to the curriculum through already built in time. A scenario that exemplifies this is earlier this year my Algebra 2 teacher told us that the only way we could review for our test was if we video called with her at 8pm the night before. It wasn't mandatory, but it was highly encouraged. Since I'm not the best at math I decided I would tune in, but that night was my sister's band concert and I missed the call. The online call did not work around my schedule and I did not get to review for my test. Online classes seem like the schedule is flexible, and granted a lot of times they are, but there are times like this where a later scheduled class conflicts with a student's personal life. Technology is one of the most useful creations of our generation and having online classes is taking advantage of it in a positive way. But it is also causing many students to fail classes and affecting young people's lack of ability to have social interactions online classes ony fuel the fire. With the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus it is unknown what the future holds for online teaching. What is known, however, is the more we allow technology to dominate our lives, the faster it will take over the world.\n",

      "Error processing text: The principal has decided that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, a student could participate in sports, work in the yearbook committee, or serve on the student council. This decision should be slightly changed so that it only applies to the students who do not participate in an extracurricular activity of any kind. After all, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students because they perform better in the classroom as a result, colleges look favorably upon students who participate in extracurricular activities, and these activities improve the health of teenagers. It is a wellestablished fact that students who participate in more activities than just classes which are already in the school curriculum do better in the classroom. They are capable of thinking more creatively about certain questions, are more comfortable and as a result better when giving presentations in front of the class, and cna even perform better in Physical Education. Extracurricular activities, while not solely responsible for this, are a large factor that affects how a student performs in the classroom. For example, Model United Nations is one activity which teaches students about various useful skills, like public speaking. Students stand up in front of the entire class giving a speech, sometimes off the top of their head, on a certain problem affecting the intense world today. Model UN is not only a useful educational tool, however, as it is also capable of helping students think about the world with a new perspective. Many topics given are about finding better solutions to certain issues prevalent in today's world. Students come out of this club brimming with new ideas, selfconfidence, and a will to learn. Sports are another activity beneficial to students. They learn skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and even get better sleep at night. One example of this is soccer, which teaches students about endurance and teamwork, all while helping them exercise. These student athletes are able to perform better in the classroom as well as in P.E. because of their athletic capabilities. College is a big part of life not just in the United States, but all over the world. By going to college, one can get a better education and in turn, a better job. However, just getting good grades in school is not enough for many of the top colleges around the world. Students also need a hook that make them stand out from the others in the eyes of the university. In fact, some colleges have given out scholarships to students for extracurricular activities. For example, playing a musical instrument, like the piano. Not only does this help with how a student does in the classroom, but colleges also look for students with musical talents and even partner with music schools for this purpose. In this way, not only can students attend a college, but they can also attend the music school that comes with it and pursue their musical education as well. Physical and mental health are a major concern revolving around students. Obesity and depression can both be linked to overworking students and not giving them enough time to go do something else. This is why schools need extracurricular activities. Sports and music are both helpful in this way. At a young age, many children are encouraged to go outside and participate in their local sports team by their parents. The parents do this so the children can get exercise and grow up leading a healthier lifestyle which combines academics and physical activity. Team sports, like soccer, football, or basketball, also teach students about teamwork and build up their selfconfidence, which benefits their mental health as well. Team members meet each other just about every week, and over time, this relationship builds into a friendship. Individuals can feel that they belong in the team and treat almost like a second family. This sense of belonging benefits their mental health, which in turn benefits their performance in the classroom, which benefits their life overall. Extracurricular activities benefit students in their performance in the classroom, attainability of higher education, and physical and mental health. However, the specific decision of the principal should be changed as students may already participate in extracurricular activities not provided by the school. For example, one may take piano lessons with a private teacher, or play on a travel soccer team with no association to the school. By forcing these students to have to pick up another extracurricular activity that is provided by the school, they may become overwhelmed with trying to manage their busy schedules. Then, all of the positive attributes of physical activities fall apart. This reason is why the decision of the principal should be changed so that only students who do not participate in any extracurricular activity of any kind will be required to take one. Otherwise, there will be drawbacks to the principal's otherwise good intentions. In conclusion, the decision of the principal, while beneficial to the students, shouild be slightly changed so that students who already partcipate in an extracurricular activity outside of school will not be required to take one provided by the school. Extracurricular activities are beneficial to students because they improve performance in the classroom, help them pursue higher education, and improve their physical and mental health overall. Students should be given every opportunity to succeed, but requiring every student to participate in a schoolbased extracurricular activity would not be fair to the students who do so outside of school. They may experience certain drawbacks as a result of the tremendous workload forced upon them, and this may also lead to weakened mental health. For this reason, the principal's decision should be changed such that it only applies to students who do not partcipate in extracurricular activites of any kind.\n",

      "Error processing text: Talking with more than one person can make decisions have a more clear best choice. Seeking advice from multiple people allows for learning from others' experiences, more inclusive actions, and different perspectives on issues. These all help a person make the best decision, and lead to the most prosperity. It can be difficult to work through tough decisions on your own, so asking others who have gone through similar circumstances can help cause a better outcome. When I was deciding whether I should apply to Awesome Math Summer Program, a prestigious math overnight camp at Cornell University, I was debating if this would be a worthwhile experience for me. It would have been the first ever time I stayed away from home by myself, and I was nervous I wouldn't make any friends. The camp was also highly priced, and I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, who were already paying for my brother's expensive private college. However, Awesome Math Summer Program is known for the classes it offers, all of which would greatly benefit me as a competitive math student. Many of the courses there were perfect for my math level, and would provide a challenge I wasn't getting in normal school math. Many of my friends said it was a great experience, but I didn't know if they were providing me the whole truth on what the camp was like. I was very conflicted on what my plan of action should be, so I turned to another person who I knew had past experience and could guide me through my decision making. My brother had already attended Awesome Math Summer Program a few years back, and he said although it wasn't suited for his style of learning, it would be a great fit for me. The lessons were more problem solving based, which was my favorite type of class. His knowledge of the program allowed me to make the best decision regarding my application to Awesome Math Summer Program, which in the end I did apply and get accepted to. My brother's advice from his own personal experiences gave me a look into a camp I wouldn't have had otherwise, and allowed me to have one of the best summers of my life. His and others' advice played a large role in me attending this program, and also have made me more including of others. One of the biggest flaws I have is that it is extremely difficult for me to focus on what others need over my own needs. It can be hard to know how to include everyone so they benefit from my actions, as well as make sure no one is being left out. However, I find I am more inclusive when I know what multiple individuals need to succeed. In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts. The judicial branch has the complicated job of making some of the most difficult decisions in our country. During the Supreme Court case of Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeir, the justices had to decide if school officials could censor the school newspaper, or if this was violation of First Amendment Rights. They worked together to deliberate the most Constitutionally fair outcome, and formed the majority opinion based off of what most justices thought was the best ruling. Each justice was able to provide their own perspective on the issue, which is especially important for court cases since everyone has different ideas on what is fair. In the end, they ruled the First Amendment did not prohibit schools from censoring the school newspaper. They were able to reach this ruling from countless hours spent in debate of the conflict, and make a fair decision based off of everyone's unique perspective. The opinions from multiple individuals help make the most just decision in a court case, as well as help decision making in real life. Most decisions do not require much indepth analyzing, but there are some can be very hard and draining to make. No matter how exhausting this can be though, there are always methods to make decision making more bearbale. One way to make this easier is to seek the advice of more than one person, as this can lead to the best choice. Others who have already been through what you are going to can give helpful advice, as well as make more inclusive decisions and give a different view on issues. From this, a person can take the best and most fair actions to help them succeed.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear, Senator Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period. Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people. Also, the electoral college causes many issues during the voting period. To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year. You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article The indefensible electoral college Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong Bradford Plumer states Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. Plumer Paragraph 10 What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose HILARY CLINTON! Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing. If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people. Furthermore, the article The indefensible electoral college Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system ae wrong Bradford explains Back in 1960, Segregationists in the louisiana legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy. This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency. The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote. Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time, People would be let down when they find out that the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency. Bradford proves this by explaining ...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please... Plumer Paragraph 11 On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article In defense of the electoral college Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president Richard A. Posner exclaims The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. Posner Paragraph 15 What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote. Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president. On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example, The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the Winnertakeall method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency. However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes. There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons to keep the electoral college in use. Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they might have as their new president. According to Bradford, the electoral college is ...Unfair, outdated, and irrational. Plumer paragraph 14 It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.\n",

      "Error processing text: Since Henry Ford made the first Model T, people have been obsessed with the idea of transportation. This idea has evolved into many things between then and now. We now have entire sports dedicated to cars and motorcycles, cars powered by alternate energy sources, and many other novel concepts that have taken the world by storm. However, there are many potential advantages of limiting your use of our precious automobiles. One of the first reasons that you should reduce your usage of cars is found all around us, in the environment. Some statistics of the current amount of damage we cause by using our cars like we do include that fact that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some areas of the United States. Imagine if we could reduce those numbers? David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America a fastgrowing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United states, said How much you drive is as important as whether you drive a hybrid. There are some places that are taking this concept to heart. One example of this is in Bogota, Columbia, where on certain days every year, a Day Without Cars in the capital city leaves only buses and taxis with permission to be on the roads. Despite the rain on the third time the event took place, the turnout was still great. There were even other cities, Cali and Valledupar, that took part in the fun. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic about what they saw. The country of Colombia has made a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprint since the mid1990s. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths as well as parks and sports centers have also cropped up. This also in turn resulted in an improved economy as new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has also recently unveiled ambitious goals to curb the US's greenhouse gas emmisions. Wouldn't it be great if we could all help the environment out by reducing our usage of cars? How great would it be, if at the same time as leanding the earth a helping hand, you were able to improve your own happiness? In Vauban, Germany and several other places globally, this has already begun to take effect. The people of this city are part of the Smart Planning movement. This experimental community on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders, is taking reducing automobile usage to a whole new level. Seventy percent of Vauban's families simply do not own a car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two living in Vauban, said When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, as she walked the verdant streetes where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering people drown out an occasional distant motor. The Smart Planning movement isn't just restricted to this place though. It is merely an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. In Bogota, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife, It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, on a Day Without Cars. Some may still say though, How if by giving up my car, will I be happier? I will have to find some other transportation mean and potentially have to wake up much earlier than I already to get everywhere. That seems more stressful to me. However, due to the recession in the US, many people are having to do adapt this type of lifestyle out of necessity. Many can't afford new vechiles but still must get to work somehow. Even after the recession ends, many sociologists believe that many will not return their previous way of life. Finally, there are already many plans in place to reduce automobile usage. At the Mobile World Congress in 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan that shows how impractical or undesireable it will be for many to own a vehicle. He also proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create ciries in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety. The Environment Protection Agency as well as legislators are promoting the reduced use of personal vehicles by working to induct a new sixyear federal transportation bill, rather than previous ones that have devoted about eighty percent of the appropriations have gone to highway improvements and the remaining twenty percent to other transport. To wrap everything up, there are many reasons that everyone should try to reduce automobile use. For one, it will help the environment, it will increase general happiness, and finally, that there are plans that are already in place to make it more feasable for people to adopt this new lifestyle. Whether we will see a drastic change or not, we will not know until we try. But that all starts, with you.\n",

However, it would appear that limiting car uie hai far more advantagei than thought of before it can help the environment, provide eaiier meani of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic congeition. To begin, it would appear ai though that limited car uiage ii a environment iaving technique. For initance, within the article In German Suburb, Life Goei On Without Cari by Eliiabeth Roienthal, it itatei of the exiitence of a imall iuburban city namei Vauban, Germany that hai nearly obiolete the uie of automobilei. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why it ii io neceiiary for thii to become a trend,Automobilei are the linchpin of iuburbi... And that, experti iay, ii a huge impediment to current efforti to draitically reduce greenhouie gai emiiiioni from tailpipe...paiienger cari are reiponiible for 12 percent of greenhouie gai emiiiioni in Europe.... Thii bit of information informi thoie that drive of the harmful effecti that our cari are creating upon the environment. However, if we are to limit our uiei of cari, and like the reiidenti of Vauban, and find alternative meani of traniportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouie gaiei that are being given off by cari. Similarly, Parii hai taken up a iimilar idea. In Robert Dufferi article, Parii bani driving due to imog he talki of the percautioni that France hai taken to driving and why. Parii hai created a ban io that thoie who have a liicenie plate that begini with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day thoie who have a liicenie plate that itarti with an odd number cannot drive. Thii all began becauie, ...after fivedayi of inteniifying imog... The imog rivaled Beijing, China, which ii known ai one of the moit polluted citiei in the world.paragraph 14. Pariii efforti to create leii imog wai a iucceii and they now implement the ban on Mondayi and Tueidayi. Due to leii driveri, they were even able to reduce the amount of imog polluting the air. Limited and reitrictive uiage on cari ieemi to be very helpful when iaving the environment. Next, the near obiolete uie of cari hai made for eaiier modei of traniportation. For example, in Eliiabeth Roienthali paiiage In German Suburb, Life Goei On Without Cari ihe telli of the many benifiti that limited car uie have upon their community. In paragraph iix ihe itatei that iuburbi are beginning to be,...more compact and more acceiiible to public traniportation, with leii ipace for parking. In thii new approach, itorei are placed a walk away, on a main itreet, rather than in malli along iome diitant highway. Thii meaning that there will be more of an eaie when traveling and everything being cloier together. No longer will people have to drive milei away for iome groceriei, they will iimply either walk or ride the bui to their deitination. They will no longer be itreiied ai to what time they have left to reach a itore that ii a diitance away. Along the iame linei, ioemtimei it can be eaiier to not drive at all. In the article The End of Car Culture the author, Eliiabeth Roienthal, itatei how many people have found diffrent meani of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirtyieven ihe iayi, New Yorki new bikeiharing program and iti ikyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolli reflect thoie new prioritiei.... From the information given, it appeari ai though finding eaiier meani of traniportation have become a new popular trend. Since pricei to travel by car are ioaring, the cheapier iolution appeari to juit be walking, or ai itated, riding a bike. Leading people to belive that the near extinction of car uiage hai left ui with eaiier meani of travel. Laitly, chooiing to not uie cari more frequently hai left ui with leii traffic. In Andrew Selikyi Carfree day ii ipinning into a big hit in Bogota he talki about the reaioing for thii. ...millioni of Columbiani hiked, biked, ikated or took buiei to work during a carfree day yeiterday, leaving the itreeti of thii capital city eerily devoid of traffic jami.paragraph 20.

Mr. Ford had to iay that, ...pedeitrian, bicycle, private cari, commercial and public traniportation traffic are woven into a connected network to iave time, conierve reiourcei, lower emiiiioni and improve iafety. paragraph 43. Thii itatement can inform the general population that from the drop in cari on the road, it can improve our iafety and iave time becauie of the fewer motoriit on the road.

      "Error processing text: Car usage all over the world has reduced and been reducing slowly. Some of the advantages of limiting car usage may be the reducing of pollution or just to save money. Also due to many different reasons, even if it's for their own needs, or to just minimize the pollution going on in different parts of the world. In many places car usage has been being limited for countries all over. If it's China, Spain, Columbia, Paris, Germany, or even the United States of America. Not all countries have taken part in trying to reduce the use of cars to an all time low. That may just be their own choice. While other countries are sure trying to cut the usage of car for a variety of reasons. Some places in the world are doing it so they can cut some of the pollution done to the world. And if you think about it if half of the world tryed as hard as they possibly could to try and minimize pollution the world wouldnt be so pulloted. I know cars aren't the only things that cause pollution, but its a pretty big part of the daily life for any person no matter where they are. In Vauban, Germany a suburban area has almost completely given up driving and even owning a car. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park Rosenthal 2 but it cost a lot of money to even own a parking space. Carowners can buy a space, for 40,000, along with a home. Rosenthal 2 That price may just be enough to keep people from owning a car all together. According to the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, 70 percent of vaughn's Families don't even own a car and 57 percent sold a car just to move there. Isn't that crazy? Imagine life without cars, it has advantages and disadvantages of course but advantages can lead to a positive outcome no matter what the reason is. By people in Vauban not owning cars they are most likely saving a lot of money because they don't have to buy the car, pay the ridiculous amount for a parking spot, and pay for the gas thats going to end up pollution the world anyway. Just a few of the many advantages in reducing or cutting out car usage completely. Due to all the terrible and mass amounts of smog in Paris, France, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air or global city Duffer 10. For example, in this article called by Robert Duffer, on monday motorist with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine which turns out to be 31 U.S. Dollars. And then the same thing would happen to those whose license plates ended in an odd number the following day. This had to have cut pollution a huge amount. If you think about how many people are living in Paris, and you think about them all staying off the road due to a ban then you may be able to understand the amount of pollution that wasn't produced during this ban. Now Paris, did this for the advantage purpose of reducing the amount of pollution they had in their air and by not adding more to it. It couldn't have a negative impact they were doing something good for the enviornment even if it didn't really help that much. Out of the whole city of Paris about 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine Duffer 12. Another advantage that Paris had due to them banning car usage was that Congestion was down 60 percent Duffer 14. The ruling French lifted the ban when the smog cleared up enough. Bogota, Columbia turned what they did as a tradition, into a big hit to tons of poeple in other countries. Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky informed the public about what was started a few years ago back in Columbia. For a day cars except for buses and taxis were banned. In the city of 7 million, the goal is to promote alternative transportation and also reduce smog. Violators faced 25 fines. Selsky 21 Due the day without cars, the city of Bogotas has 118 MILES of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American City. Selsky 27 One advantage they had was that because of the day with out cars the parks and sports centers have been in the best shape they could possibly be in. They also did have to reduced the amount of pollution that was being put into the air, because it was such a big hit to other cities and countries. Yet another article by Elisabeth Rosenthal called , is stating the advantages in the United States and what has happened with the reducing of cars. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Rosenthal 29 The minimizing of cars in The U.S. has some advantages those being, Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions Rosenthal 29. New York City for example is home to the heart of public transportation due to all the taxis and the subway. Not many people in New York city drive or even own a car due to the congested streets, and the ridiculous amount of money you have to have just to park it like it was in Germany. Crazy amounts of money to park a car is just an outrage. The advantage here would be the money saved by not even owning a car and storing it. Another one would be the traffic is bad but not as bad as it would be if more people had cars. Public transportation is huge in New York. It's already expensive enough to live in New York imagine if there werent as many taxis and if the subway wasn't there at all. Picture all the pollution there would be. To wrap up everything, as stated there are many advantages to reducing car usage all around the world. If it was to reduce smog or pollution of just to save money they are still advantages to decreasing the amount of times you use a car. If something is in walking distances why not just walk instead of taking a car and wasting money and also polluting the air unless it's a hybrid. The limiting of car usage is slowly but surely growing all over the world. Yes, cars are faster to get places, but why waste the money and clean air to be somewhere quickly? Think of all the advantages there are in reducing car usage not the disadvantages.\n",

      "Error processing text: Cars have been popular and widely used ever since they were invented. They offer a fast and efficient form of transportation across both long and short distances. In this aspect, cars may appear extremely beneficiary and useful in everyday life, but there are always downsides to great inventions, especially the invention of the car. More and more people from all around the world are realizing the harms that car usage brings and are beginning to abandon their cars altogether. The most apparent reason as to why cars are damaging is because of the great amount of greenhouses gases they emit into the atmosphere. They also bring about pollution and smog with them. Finally, and maybe surprisingly to some, people are actually happier without these pollution monsters. To start, cars expel shocking amounts of greenhouses gases from their tailpipe. By limiting usage of these automobiles, the amount of green house gases can be significantly reduced. According to the source, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, cars produce up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in places like Europe, but an eyepopping 50 percent in the United States where there is heavy car usage. This is a lot of noxious gas that is being put into the atmosphere, and poses a serious harm to the people living in these cities. Greenhouse gases are an especially maleficent form of pollution because greenhouse gases tend to trap heat and other types of pollution from escaping the atmosphere, leaving filth in the air that are then absorbed by the lungs, choking cities Rosenthal 8. This is without a doubt a serious problem, but it can be corrected simply by not driving as frequently. According to The End of Car Culture, But America's love affair with it vehicles seems to be cooling...If the pattern persistsand many sociologists believe it willit will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants Rosenthal 3234. Simply by reducing car usage, these harmful toxins can be removed from the atmosphere. Pollution is another quite obvious reason to why restricting car usage is beneficial. Cars release other toxins and gases as well that contribute greatly to pollution and smog. Paris bans driving due to smog tells the story of how driving had to be banned for days because of the worst pollution the city has ever seen. According to this passage, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog...Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 144 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found Duffer 1417. This is a ton of particulate matter that will be all breathed in by the people there if they are not removed. Paris, Brussels, and London are not only the cities plagued by this pollution from cars as The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world Duffer 14. Smog from pollution negatively effects many aspects of life, but the worst was that Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions Duffer 14. This phenomenon forces the people to breathe these particles into their lungs. Pollution is a terrible occurence that tags along with car usage, but by simply banning cars with evennumbered licnese plates off the road for one day, the smog greatly lightened in severity, enough for the city of Paris to lift the ban. No one wants pollution in their city, and simply by cutting back on car usage, pollution can be greatly reduced for the benefit of the people. Finally, and most surprisingly, people are actually happier and less stressed without these modern horses. Heidrum Walter, a mother who lives in the city of Vauban Germany, a community devoid of cars, says in the passage, Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , 'When I had a car I was tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal 3.' Carlos Arturo Plaza, a man in Bogota, Colombia, also commented during Bogota's Day Without Cars, in the source, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota 'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution Selsky 24.' This may seen a little puzzling at first as to why people would not enjoy fast and convenient transportation, but then the answer becomes pretty obvious. Without cars, parks, sport centers, and other outdoor recreational places have started to pop up more amd more on the streets of cities once bustling with cars. The roads are much less congested and new shops and food centers have appeared as well. Limiting cars pleases people in many different aspects of their life. Cars may appear to be helpful at times, but in reality, citizens are better off without these transportation machines. Not only do they greatly pollute the air and cause smog, they also spew out noxious greenhouse gases that cause more damage to the society as a whole. Finally, and probably most importantly, the citizens themselves enjoy life better when these cars are out of them. Although this doesn't mean cars should stop being manufactored altogether, people should think twice before jumping in their car next time.\n",

      "Error processing text: The presidential elections are a huge deal in the United States and everywhere else. We all sit on anticipation to see who our next leader is hoping that they will make great changed for their country and their people, eventually making it a great place to live. Not many people are well informed about this system we have here, and some are. But could you imagine if more people find out that they aren't actually voting for the President but instead your are voting for the people that are voting for the President? Does that make any sense? As you very well know there are two sides to every story Senater. Many people agree with the electoral Collage and many people don't. However my personal belief is that you should not support the electoral Collage. I believe that this system is unfair, it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and who's running the country as well as the fact that many people voted for the electoral Collage may make the wrong decisions which could jeopardize the election and lets not forget about the winner take all system. To begin with, the first reason I don't think you should support the electoral Collage is because the system is unfair and it doesn't give Americans full control over elections and their results. During Election time people are tricked into thinking that they are voting for the President. They play Presidential ad for campaigns and the candidates go give speeches around the country. But if your not really voting for the Presidents, then why are they wasting all this money and wasting your time having you watch the ads. Source two it says If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirtyfour electoral votes. Who are the electors? amd in source 1 it says THe fouding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise. But honest is it really a compromise is you're not involved? People want to be involved in this type of stuff, believe it or not it matters to them. And because you are not really told, people could go on for years thinking that their voting for the actual President but instead they are voting for politicans and hoping that they make the right decisions. Are we really going to leave the fait of our country up to hope and up to people that don't really know what their voting for. This is not fair and it doesn't live up to American values. Another reason that you shouldn't support the electoral Collage is because many of the politicans that people vote for make the wrong decisions and could jeopardize the future of our country. Everyone makes mistakes but in presidential elections you can't, it is veyr important that things are monitered closely. After all you are voting for a person who is going to run and represent your country. But many politicians feel that since they have power that they can do whatever they want. Even go as far as rigging election votes so they can win. in source two it states that Those electors could always defy the will of the people. In other words they may not listen to what the people want and instead be selfish and listen to what they want. Now of course we know this isn't right. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. This isn't fair to the people, because by doing that you are saying they don't have a say. And people have a lot of trouble trusting politicians, would you blame them it's not every day that you come across a person who wants the best for their people and puts them first instead of themselves. The final reason that you shouldn't approve or support the electoral System is because of the Winners take all system. In this system candidates really don't bother going or speaking or visiting the state their running in. This basically means that the people who vote for them are making a blind vote without really knowing the person. Before voting for anyone in any situation student council, Goverment, and ect. You need to know that person. You need to make sure that they share the same values that you do. You need to make sure that they are the best candidate for the state and not some random street alcoholic. People have enough trouble trusting politicans as it is why make it worse? During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. This statement also includes political ads, they saw none at all. And you expect them to vote for the President of the United States without prior knowledge how is that even allowed? That is why I call it a blind vote. However even in the midst of all that wrong with electoral System people have found right in it. For instance source 3 says that But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Although this statement has some truth to it, it also has some false. The problem that i have with that statement is that there are no facts to back it up. Sure you believe that our trust is rarely betrayed but actually you don't know. Politicans are very secrative and protected at all cost. You have no ideas what going on in their office unless they make a public announcement on it and sometimes that's even a lie. We don't know our politicans really well on a personal basis, sure you might think you do because they go on tv shows tell you about their life but how much of that is truth and how much is lie? Sometimes politicans lie to protect the people from pain or ect. But you shouldn't being doing that in the middle of one of the most important elections the country ever has. And if we mess up some how the only way we fix it is either impeaching the president or waiting another four years to hopefully make sure things go right and get a good President. Are you willing to take that chance? To reiterate the bottom line is that these electoral Collages are important. The people we select in our office are important. However if we let our people become involved in actual Presidental elections we are leaving the future of our country up to hope and to people who make the wrong decisions as well as the Winner takes all system. Is that really what we want for our country? People need to be involved thats why its called The United States of American. We are suppose to be united. Sure our government could be a little corrupt at times but maybe by letting people become more involved we may actually be looking forward to a brighter and better America. Which is what we all want.\n",

      "Error processing text: For most people it is more common to get from place to place by hopping in a car. But, what if we never used cars, or at least limited them? Lives would be impacted in a very positive way. In In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paris bans driving due to smog , by Robert Duffer, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in bogota , by Andrew Selsky, and The End of Car Culture , by Elisabeth Rosenthal the authors show how cars are not a necessity to life and how our communities can even be better off without them. Because of the positive impact on our environment and the increase of a community, limiting car usage is a serious idea worth of a second look. Cars, especially in America, are a major source of transportation. Without them many people would not have an easy way to commute to where they need to be. But, convince is causing more pain than pleasure and starting to harm our environment. Cars just by themselves cause around fifty percent of the greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere. Similarly they cause twelve percent in Europe par. 5 Logically it would make sense to find the root of a problem and change it to make the problem go away, but in the case of cars, cars are a root in the pollution problem, but many people need them to ge to get where they need to be. The easiest solution to this is to limit our car use and add more busses and easier, more accessible areas for bikes and walking. Pollution will lower and people will still get to where they need to be. Pollution is a major topic regarding the safety of our environment and cars have been a proven source of much of the pollution in the air. Using less cars coensides with less pollution in our surroundings. Paris, France was suffering from very high pollution in the air. To combat this, for five days certain people, based on their lisecense plate number, were not allowed to use their cars. Though not everyone complied, after the five days the smog went from the levels found in the worst city for pollution, Beijing China, down by sixty percent par.14. In just under a week Paris went from being the most polluted it had ever been to a better, safer level. If a city just by limiting the car usage by half was able to make such a drastic difference in that time, imagine it being limited more over a wider area. There is a possibility of totally correcting the pollution problem worldwide, or at least making it better and more easily handled. Although the environment is important, cars are also affecting the way we interact as people in a community. Because we have cars, we never really see the senery around us. We exit our houses, jump in our cars, drive, and walk ito our destination. There is no contact with nature or other people passing by. Limiting cars can lead to the increase of interaction and better looking cities. In Bogota, there is a day once a year called carfree day, in which no one is allowed any use of their personal cars and fined if they do not comply. Because of this there has been an increase in new highend resturants and places to shop. The community has also added more city parks and places for sports. There is no traffic rush hour and due to the increased walking the old broken sidewalks have been replaced with larger new ones par.28. No one wants to not only have to walk, but have to walk on a surface that is hard to walk on and unappealing. Due to this, people started to create parks and sports centers for a nice place to be as well as a nice place to look at. And because of the increased foot traffic, there have been more people opening shops and resturants, as no one speeding by in a car will notice a small corner store, but someone strolling by, taking in the scenery will. In response to the increased foot traffic, it is important that there is somewhere to actually put your foot, and old cracked pavement won't cut it. If there are less cars, less road pavement is needed and more sidewalk pavement is. So, the old pavement is replaced with more pavement that is in better shape. All the walking and passing people causes people to be more social and to interact more often. The members of a community are more together. Mr. Sivak, a researcher, had noticed both of his children are not interested in getting a driver's licence. Everything they do is centered around walking, public transport, and carpooling. They don't find it necissary to have a car and licence par. 39. The children of the researcher don't have or need a car because what they do doesn't require them to have one. They get a more full experience not being in a car all the time. In a carpool they get to socialize with friends and while walking they get an outdoor and community experience. In short, cars are an easy way to get from area to area, but they are very harful to the environment and our community. They add pollution to the air and cut off our everyday contact. If we limited the use of cars we would lower pollution, casuse our cities to be more attractive, have better ways of transport, and be closer as people in an area. So, is a car still going to be your most common way of transport? Think of the good you would do to the world if it wasn't.\n",

      "Error processing text: Go outside and take a deep breath, as it is right now you may feel refreshed and may even feel twinge of joy as you just took in a breath of the wonderful natural and clean air. But, as it so happens with the increase of greenhouse gases in the world, in just a few years this may not be the same situation. Instead of enjoying your breath, you may be coughing or choking on the polluted air. In the past few decades, our air pollution has gone up drastically and most of that comes from our cars. According to Source 1, written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars in Europe make up 12 percent of its greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in areas in the United States! That's a whole lot! Rest assured though, there is an easy and crucial way we can begin to cut down those numbers we must begin to limit our car usage. Already, you may question this and begin to wonder if it is even a possible or logical request. Well, it is in many places throughout the world, communities have begun to forget about their cars and use bikes, walking, and more public transportation options instead of their cars. It can happen, in In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she informs us about an upscale community in Vauban, Germany where its residents have given up their reliance on cars. It's streets have no cars, except for the tram that runs to its downtown areas. While everyone is still allowed to own a car, and some do, they must park it at one of the only two areas to park in large garages where an owner must buy a space for up to 40,000! You may think that it's crazy but in reality it is not. The structure of the city allows almost everything to be in close proximity to one another reducing the need for a car. Many citizens have reported to be feeling better and happier as they feel more carefree and have the stress that cars bring removed from their lives. This helps to reduce the emission produced by cars and Vauban is one of the most successful cities and have been an influence in many areas. Now, if you are not up to the idea of completely giving up your car then, there are several alternatives that you can do to help and will still reduce and limit your car usage. In Source 3, by Andrew Selsky, Mr. Selsky brings to us a fairly new tradition that started about 3 years ago in Bogota, Colombia. Bogota is Colombia's capital and one of the most populated cities. Bogota has a citywide day called, Day Without Cars. It is simple enough, buses and taxis are only permitted while cars are banned. Millions of people walked, biked, skated, or found other ways of getting to work and frankly enjoyed it. Other citizens reported it as a fun day to take away stress while helping our endangered enviroment. This day that started only 3 days ago has now spread to other areas such as Cali and Valledupar, and Asuncion, Paraguay. Not only do these days help the enviroment but it also helps the citizens. All throughout Bogota, new parks and sports centers have been built, old and cracked sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones, and new areas for income such as restaurants and upscale shopes have popped up around the city as well. The reason for the building and new employment of jobs is so that people will have reasons to walk around and allow for it to be more convient for others who work near by the areas. We also notice a similar idea arise in the lovely city of Paris, France. For those who don't know while Paris is known for it's impressive architecture and beautiful sights, it also has a bad reputation of being very polluted. This pollution comes from the amount of tourists it recieves as well as the different and populous amounts of motor transportation. In Source 2 by Robert Duffer, we see he examines several days in which the city of Paris bans driving due to the record amounts of pollution in the air. For those who were driving when they weren't supposed to be were fined and a few even had their car impounded for their reactions to the fine. Unfortunately, the government established in Paris realized that they had to do this after 5 full days of intensifying smog. At first, many were scared, confused, and even upset as to why this was happening but they began to see that it was neccessary. Once their levels of smog began to normalize, congestion is Paris was down about 60 percent! All in all, we need to begin limiting our usage of cars, from the examples provided it shows that in the end, it isn't such a bad thing after all. It increases, activities to do, work opportunities for people, and reduces air pollution. While, they were able to save Paris this time, next time they may not be so lucky. In the United States, according to Source 4 which is very reliable, we actually see a decrease in car usage overall. These rates have dropped for several reasons, and have about the same results and benefits. People have begun getting healthier, emission rates have decreased. While the idea of limiting car usage may scare some people, it is proved to be extremely helpful. Limiting car usage helps reduce emissions, and increases job opportunities and everything.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear State Senator, Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country our President and Vice President. We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights. I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices. The Electoral College has major flaws. Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions. Source A in paragraph 12 states, In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly. The other countries would take us as a joke we would simply look like fools. Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote. Source B also in paragraph 12 says, Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million. That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70. That is a tremendous difference in population. Don't let our country plummet into bad election. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote. With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right. Source C says, At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the swing states. Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000. Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads. Just as Source D states, The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people. What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress? It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if it happened again? Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush? Thank that to the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. But why? First of all, Source E states, So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does. But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair. The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do. This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play. It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California. Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, They are the most thoughtful voters, on average and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Once again, this statement is unfair. This is favoritism. This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more thoughtful. Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote. People want to make their own decisions. It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities we want to feel important. With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote. So it's official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason. It's fair. There's only one thing I have to say to you. State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.\n",

      "Error processing text: Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. vaughn's streets are entirely carfree except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for 40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of vaughn's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called smart planning. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars. Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 fine. The same would apply to the oddnumbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just fivedays of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates the following day. Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this carfree day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, Day Without Cars. 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. The rain hasn't stopped people from participating, said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a twoseat bicycle. Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T the home of Detroit the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized Mustang Sally. Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn, said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. I think that means something more fundamental is going on, he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bikesharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of carsharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being safety, money, and pollution.\n",

      "Error processing text: As the global concern for the environment increases with time, the desire to use cars decreases. People are aware that cars release fumes which, when combined, can be detrimental for the environment, and they want to do something about it. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes in her New York Times article, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, that up to fifty percent of environmental greenhouse gas pollution comes from the cars driven in American suburbs. In her article, she quotes David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America, that All of our the U.S.A.'s development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. It seems like America, and the rest of the world, is becoming more aware about what cars can do to the environment and that car usage needs to decrease, and they are taking steps to do so. So why should you limit your car usage? By limiting car usage, the average citizen can decrease pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that are causing damage to the environment, improve living conditions in large cities and reduce smog, and feel better in general, with more exercise and less stress. In the past decade, America has struggled with an obesity epidemic. In the early 2000s, obesity was at its peak, with mcdonald's Super Size menu options, huge SUVs, and endless television programs to keep couch potatos on the couch. If you visit New York City's Manhattan, you won't see a whole lot of obese people hurrying down 5th avenue to hop on the subway or pick up groceries at the local market. Why is this? Not many people drive in NYC, mainly because it would be far too expensive to buy and park a car in this already monumentally expensive city. The cars one does generally see are either from out of state, taxis, or businessmen who live in the other boroughs of the city. Very few who live in Manhattan drive. Most people take the subway, walk, or use bikes to get around. Because of the way it's made, everything one needs is just a few blocks away, from the grocery store, to the drugstore, to the postoffice, to the bank, there really is no need to have a car. If you have to go to the airport, just take a cab. Naturally, people who walk and bike everywhere are slimmer and healthier. In the suburbs, this is not the story. Many people in the suburbs drive cars out necessity, because it would take the whole day to walk to the grocery store and back. The way suburbs are set up, walking or biking is almost impossible to do if it's not for leisure. Driving around all day to pick up kids, go to work, and finally pull into the home garage can be draining and stressful. If people were to get around and get exercise at the same time, they would be less stressed and healthier. Andrew Selsky quoted businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza in his article, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Plaza said that, It's limiting car usage a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Many people are already doing this. Vauban, Germany, is a new carfree suburb. In this town, things are close together, just like a city, eliminating the need to use cars. It is not illegal to own a car in Vauban, but people who do must pay a heavy fine and pay for parking on the edge of the city that is also highly expensive. People in the German suburb get along fine without cars, because of the way the city was built. The idea of a carreduced community appeals to the U.S. as well, and legislators and other government officials are trying to make it happen for the environment as well as the sake of the people. Bejjing is supposedly the most polluted city in the world, and Paris the most beautiful, but Paris is more polluted than one would think. Robert Duffer reports in his article, Paris bans driving due to smog, that Paris, after suffering from five days of intensive smog called for some drivers to abstain from using their cars for the day or face a fine of twentytwo euros. The system was based on license plate numbers. One day, the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be able to drive, the next the ones with odd numbered license plates. This helped reduce smog in the city, which is more polluted than others in Europe like Brussels and London. Once the smog cleared, the ban was rescinded. This ban on cars, although only for a short period of time, is actually a great idea. Emissions from cars cause a large amount of smog to pollute the air, which is bad for both the inhabitants of the city and the environment. The reduction of the use of cars will reduce the amount of smog in the air in large cities, and improve the living conditions in those cities. Almost two centuries ago, smog, soot, and dirt covered Victorian London and its people. This smog was not from cars, but rather from the rising popularity of factories powered by fossil fuels such as coal. Today, all cities of the world are polluted, and almost two hundred years have passed. Shouldn't some improvements regarding the environment and smog in cities have been made by now? There is just as much environmental damage being done as there was in 19th century London, but now, instead of factories being the main cause, it's cars. Although cities are cleaner now, they are just as polluted. In Bejjing, some say the air is so dirty that if you blow your nose, your tissue turns black! It is the 21st century, and we have to be taking strides to improve the environment for the good of the people who live in cities like Paris and Bejjing. Limiting car usage is important to create a better living environment for people as well as improve their wellbeing, but the most important reason is to limit pollution and damage to the environment due to emmisions from cars. President Obama, according to Elisabeth Rosenthal in her article, The End of Car Culture, has ambitious goals to curb the Unites States' greenhouse gas emissions. If the President of the United States is concerned, this means it is a real problem. The immense amount of greenhouse gases caused by cars has already aided Global Warming and the damage to the ozone layer that exists today. If car usage increases or holds steady, even more damage will be done, so much so that it may become unfixable in the future. If the world does not cut back now on its vehicle usage and reduce environmental damage, things will only get harder to fix. But things are looking good for Mother Nature, because according to all four articles given, including, In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paris bans driving due to smog, by Robert Duffer, Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, by Andrew Selsky, and The End of Car Culture, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, people are already taking steps to reduce the use of cars and better the environment. Ever since the Model T came out in the early 20th century, cars have become more and more popular in America as well as around the world. They have become so popular, in fact, that they have become a problem. Cars emit harmful greenhouse gases that pollute the environment and cause excess smog in large cities. They can also be stressful and unhealthy for people who depend on them for everyday modes of transport. Limiting car usage is important and will help not only the environment, but also the people of the world.\n",

Having your own car is very wonderful, you get to have the space to yourself no noisy people around you, you can turn the music all the way up if you wanted to. Yes, all that's great for you but, have you thought about the consequences? Well, not consequences per say but there are bad side effects to having a car. The biggest reason being is that heavy car usage can pollute the air and harm the environment as well as yourself. Some people think that cars aren't the biggest reason as to why the air is polluted, and use that as an excuse to keep driving. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. quoted from source 2. The smog that was mentioned was from the over usage of cars in Pairs, smog that heavy could be toxic and very bad for your health. Heavy car usage does pay a strong role in the pollution that we have. Since most people who have a car use it all the time, I could just imagine how bad the air is right now. Due to the high smog levels in Paris they had to put a ban on using cars, and if someone were to use their cars they would be charged a 22euro fine which is 31 USD. This ban was later lifted to oddnumbered plates when the smog cleared enough. Pairs wasn't the only one to ban cars. As quoted from source 1 VAUBAN, GermanyResidents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before they have given up their cars. In Vauban, Germany they have completly taken away cars! Unlike some people who can't live without their car for more than 2 days, A whole community has been without one for much longer. when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter, quoted from source 1. Without a car they have nothing to worry about and in term live much happier lives, they also save up money since they don't have to pay for gas, doesn't that sound good? Now, you don't have to go to the extremes of giving up your car completly but limiting the amount of times you use your car would be a fantastic start and if everyone around the world limits the amount of time they use their car by half, even by a quarter, the air around us would be much more clean and happy. Alternatives other than using your car can be going on a train or bus, and yes I know I said that they can be a little unappealing, but I rather suffer a couple of minutes on a bus or train than having the long term effects of a polluted environment. Don't like the idea of going on public transportation? How about car pooling? If your friend wants you to drop them off somewhere that's on your way to work anyhow, give it to them, beats having them drive their car and get more pollution in the air. As stated in Source 4 I was curious about what kind of car people drove, but young people don't really car. A car is just a means of getting from A to B when BART doesn't work. BART is reffering to the Bay Area Rapid Transit. As you can see, even young people would rather take public transportation if available. Cutting down car usage can also mean you get to go out for more walks than usual! Walking is very important for your health but also for the environment, since of course, walking doesn't cause pollution. As stated in source 3 Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. This all happend in Bogota, Colombia ever since their Day Without Cars started, their community and outdoor lives have improved dramatically. Walking can give you a chance to get some fresh air and cool your minds off things you might be dealing with. If you don't want to walk alone, walk with a friend and get to know each other better, don't just sit in a car talking on the phone with them, cars have made people less interactive. Invite your friends to go out walking with you, to a park, to the mall maybe catch a movie, or something else along those lines. Not only walking, but biking or skatebording can be a fun alternative, distract your mind with other activities or find a fun and enjoyable way for you to get you fom one place to the next, without the use of a car! But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. quoted from source 4. This is an amazing start for us in the US, we are slowly growing away from cars, or well, we seem to be a little less interested in them than we were years ago! We still have a long way to go, but, I strongly believe that going without cars or using cars less is a real benefit to our society, and to us as individuals.\n",

Whether it's going to schoolwork, hanging with friends or anywhere really people rely on their cars for everything and you never hear anyone talk about walking, biking and taking another way of transportation. It's whole new era with how are society is created and working but it's how we are living, and it seems to be working. Elisabeth Rosenthal, Robert Duffer, and Andrew Selsky all have the same mindset when talking about cars while each are talking about a different reason to decrease car usage, they all have a common interest in wanting it to be implied or simply like how it is being enforced. So after reading very specific, factual, and information articles I now know the advantages of limiting car usage and that is to save time and businesses, conserve resources, and having a vast decrease in car culture. Imagine yourself on a bad morning, you woke you late and you're probably rushing out the door for work, and as a fellow American I would know that there is early morning traffic no matter where you are headed. But if you didn't use a car and maybe walked or rode a bike you could easily get there faster if it was a reasonable distance. In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets fo this capital city eerily to devoid of traffic jams Selsky, par 20. This goes to show that when people took other steps to get to work instead of cars that there was no traffic jams. Which means no waitng which also means getting to work at a normal time, or for some, even on time. When you think about it you know that the roads can be a really busy and hetic place to be if you time it just right, so if you take the extra measure and maybe walk home you can easily make faster time and not just that but it helps the environment. Now another advantage of not using cars is businesses start to flourish. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Selsky, par 28. Since many people have decided not to use their cars they walk or bike and that can lead to going to places near by which would mean they see more of their city than they did in a car. More eyes are to catch businesses and they find themselves walking into a store because they aren't rushed andor it might just look intersting which is a huge benefit for companies. Secondly, another advantage on limiting car usage would be conserving resources. This is a very major step when it comes to the environment and things like these should be enforced for a greener Earth. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States Rosenthal, par 5. This is damaging our Earth and the only to prevent it is to limit your car use. Because how it's happening and how it's polluting our Earth is from the cars tailpipes when it releases the exhaust. Due to this hazardly problem laws are starting to be made to limit the use. Towns and cities have tried to come up with a nodriving day to decrease the use and help the environment, and in many cases it has worked while in some, it hasn't. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city Duffer, par 10. In effect to this 'experiment' it is shown that this way of thinking had changed Paris pollution decreased and congestion in traffic was down and the smog that was being created by cars had stopped the next couple of days. It's unbelievable to know what can happen when you limit yourself. Finally, it is clear that there is a decrease in car culture. There have been recent studies that imply that more Americans aren't driving or just plain out don't want to get their licenses. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009... Rosenthal, par 41. We aren't really understanding as to why this is happening. Maybe it's because they are afraid of getting a ticket, their parents haven't allowed it, they are against pollution it's not known. But what we do know is that yes, it's saving the environment but it's hurting the car businesses. If the pattern presists and many sociologists believe it will have a beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emission, just behind power plants Rosenthal, par 34. Yes, this is going to increasingly better our enivornment by not having more cars on the road to pollute, but it will for sure hurt the car industry. Not many people even have the money to go out a buy a car in this economy. And from the car businesses in ruins, some are even rebranding themselves. The change in car culture is known for much less commuting due to technology as well. Lastly, a reminder of the advantages in limiting car usage are saving time and businesses, conserving resources and a decrease in car culture. So when you're on the road, start thinking about ways to stop your use of cars and see how it would benefit the environment cause the more we drive around the worse our Earth will become.\n",

      "Error processing text: The Electoral College is a process that has been used in the United States Government for many years. It is the process that selects a candidate for Presidency based on electoral votes rather than the popular vote of the people. Many believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, but if we were to take it out of our governmental system, it would take away most of the effectiveness of our elections. The United States election process has worked very efficiently for many years with this process of election, it is very effective for choosing a candidate, and when it comes down to it, the last process of the Electoral College House of Representatives stepping in when there is a tie is very unbiased and is also effective in choosing a candidate. If we were to abolish the Electoral College, the United States government would basically be starting over with their election process, which isn't necessarily a good idea once you are nearly 300 years into being an official country. The United states election process has worked very effectively with the Electoral College for a large amount of years. There is no reason why it should be abolished from the country. Throughout all of these elections, the best candidate was chosen for each presidency in the end because of this great process of election. Rather than choosing the majority of the people, which could have a biased opinion, it is left up to both the citizens and a vote in Congress. This forms a balance between the two opinions. It is a very evenly based system, as said in Source 3 In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our deprived methods of choosing the President, the article states that The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. This means that just by having one region of the United States really respect you and vote for you, this does not mean you are going to win the election. No region can get you the win. There simply are not enough electoral votes. Therefore, you must cover the most ground possible in the United States, because the more states you win over, the better your chances of becoming president are. The Electoral College is a very efficient process of election. Instead of only the people voting and the decision of who becomes president left to the popular vote, the power of selection for presidency is evenly spread between Congress and the people. Some say that the electoral college is unfair, and that it is irrational. This is stated in the article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong written by Bradford Plumer. He states The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. This means Plumer believes that those who argue in favor of the electoral collegee do not take a look at the reality of things when talking about this subject. The electoral collegee is very fair when it comes to the election of a president, because we all want to choose the best candidate for the job, and the only way to do that is to have an effective system for choosing a candidate without having a biased opinion tossed into the mix to mess up the process. It's sort of like a job interview. You show what you have to offer to the boss in this case it is the whole country, and if you are chosen for the job that means you were the most qualified and that you are the best choice for the job. Whichever candidate gets chosen for the job was obviously the best candidate at the time, and there is nothing that anyone can do to change that. The one situation that most people worry about within the electoral collegee is when there is a tie in the electoral vote. In this situation, the decision of the election would be placed into the hands of the House of Representatives and the Senate chooses the VicePresidential candidate best suited for the job. It does not matter how many representatives there are for any one state, as stated in the article The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. He states that Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, representing 35 million voters. This means that no state has more power than another in this process, and every representative has the same amount of power when it comes down to chooosing a candidate best suited for being president. Additionally, it creates a sense of balance between all of the states and nobody has an unfair advantage when electing the next president. As you can see, the electoral collegee is a very effective process used in the United States to choose a presidential candidate that should not be abolished from the country. With this system, the country has functioned very effectively for a very long time, the system is very effective for choosing a candidate best suited for the presidential position, and it is very unbiased and fair when it comes down to the decision of the House of Representatives for the election. Abolishing this efficient process would just do a disservice to the country's election process, and I highly doubt that any wholehearted citizen of the United States of America would want to do that to his or her own home country.\n",

      "Error processing text: The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unnecessarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished. To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford plumber's article, Back in 1960, segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy 11. If the louisiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to plumber's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use? Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winnertakeall system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winnertakeall system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winnertakeall system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled swing states. With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a tossup carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion... 21. While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced. In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear Senator, The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizensOffice of the Federal register. Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process. In Richard poster's, In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winnertakeall basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, In 2012's election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and rodney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state Posner 1. With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the candidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not acknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress The Office of the Federal Register 1. This adds support that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a successful one. In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, What Is The Electoral College, there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the candidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reiterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...Office of the Federal Register 1. In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the candidates. To add for support, Posner says, No region has enough electoral votes to elect a presidentPosner 1. With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the candidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen tp the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the electionPosner 1. Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens. Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now Plumer 1. The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors... Plumerr 1. This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues. In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election Posner 1. The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.\n",

If ithis happened, ithe elecition of ithe presidenit would be puit in ithe hands of ithe House of Represenitaitives. In ithis sysitem, each sitaite casits only one voite, so ithe represenitaitive from Wyoming who is casiting a voite for 500,000 voiters would have as much say as ithe represenitaitive from California, whose single voite represenits ithe opinion of 35 million voiters.

      "Error processing text: Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different designs, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutantss given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollution so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutants emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy. The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutantss coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities. If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves. The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog... The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want without rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway Source 1. With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things. When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freeedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, Rosenthal When Heirdrum means this way, she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them. Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks rushhour will be cut traffic and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety' Source 4. In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.\n",

People questioon whether or onot abaondooniong cars as our primary use of traonsportatioon is worth the health of the eonviroonmeont. The simple aonswer to that is obvious, there would be ono awareoness, ono statistics, ono movemeonts to preveont the use of cars, if there wereon't aony issue with them. Elimionationg cars as our primary source of traonsportatioon is almost impossible, meaoniong that the solutioon to this fossil fuel emissioon problem must be aon alteronative source of eonergy. As techonology has advaonced, so has the miondset the majority of the moderon society's populatioon towards the issues of cars. Has the miondset of the populatioon surpassed the advaoncemeont of techonology, or have we beeon igonoriong the fact that these fossil fuels emissioons have beeon detrimeontal to our eonviroonmeont. The oone major thiong that has caught everyoone's atteontioon is that the health of our eonviroonmeont beiong onegatively impacted by the use of cars everyday. This is because this is the problem that should catch everyoone's atteontioon. People have this false onotioon that we woont see aony eonviroonmeontal chaonges ion our lifetime, so this meaons we doont have to worry about this onow. The problems that we predicted would occur have beeon occurriong over the past few years. A prime example of this would be ion Paris. Paris had beeon experieonciong some weather problems. There was aon abuondaonce of smog that was filliong the air, aond diesel fuel was blamed. Paris eonforced a partial driviong baon as a solutioon to the smog problem. By elimionationg cars as a use of traonsportatioon, some questioons may occur. How will exteronal delivery compaonies be able to deliver. By onot beiong able to deliver, these compaonies will lose reveonue, due to the fact that Paris has a partial baon oon driviong. Sionce this is most likely temporary, aond a partial baon, this problem may be elimionated from the coons list of implemeontiong this regulatioon. But a correlatioon occurred. After the partial baon of driviong, the smog disappeared. This shows that by elimionationg cars as a use of traonsportatioon this would have a sigonificaont effect oon our harmed eonviroonmeont. Aonother fallacy that the majority of the populatioon has is that the oonly problem faciong the use of cars as the moderon society's primary source of traonsportatioon is that cars harm the eonviroonmeont. Eveon though this is the problem that we all oneed to face onow, there are other tedious thiongs that come with the adoptioon of cars. Bogota, Columbia, has had extreme coongestioon, has created a movemeont that has beeon so successful it has spread to other couontries. This movemeont ionvolves the populatioon abaondooniong their cars for oone day aond usiong aony other possible meaons of traonsportatioon. This movemeont eoncourages the elimionatioon of cars, physical fitoness, aond the elimionatioon of traffic jams. The populatioon of Bogota is so dedicated to this movemeont, that they have participated on this movemeont through bad weather coonditioons. This movemeont treats itself like a fuondameontal holiday to have every year. It' s a good oppurtuonity to take away stress aond lower air pollutioon. Carlos Arturo Plaza participaont of the movemeont. As you caon see the process of elimionationg cars as our primary source of traonsportatioon is a very difficult thiong to accomplish. Bogota, Columbia's movemeont to abaondoon cars for oone day is the closest the moderon society has gotteon to this. For this reasoon, there should be aon alteronate source of eonergy cars should ruon off of. By the eonviroonmeontal issues faciong the use of cars, there have beeon maony other problems that have sprouted because of the awareoness that the moderon society's citizeon has onow. Through the support of cars as the primary source of the moderon populatioon's traonsportatioon, there has beeon aon abuondaonce of users of cars. Sionce there was aon overproductioons of cars, seeiong how this is the primary source of traonspotatioon, statistics have occurred showiong the true daongers of the effects that the overuse of cars has oon our eonviroonmeont. By implemetiong aon alteronate source of eonergy that is onot harmful to the eonviroonmeont, this would fix the majority of the problems. Ionstead we have beeon focusiong oon selfdriviong cars ionstead of cars that will be able to sustsaion our eonviroonmeont before it's too late. A poteontial solutioon is eonergy efficieoncy, but the onumber oone solutioon is awareoness. Eoncouragiong awareoness is the oone thiong that caon produce more poteontial solutioons.\n",

      "Error processing text: Thousands of Americans use their own car or a vehicle as their main transportation in their every day lives. No one seems to look at how cars are actually destroying the environment ,rather then helping it. Mainly since the fuel that is given off from a vehicles engine is effecting the environment in a negative way. In all reality the reason why we as humans use our own vehicles is because its a faster way of transportation and carries us to our destination. This is why limiting car usage will be beneficial money wise and create a healthier environment. Reducing the car usage is beneficial to creating a cleaner and safer environment. Not only will this effect the environment but your life as well. According to source 1 it states, Passengers cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe. Based on this fact I can acknowledge the fact of how automobiles can effect the greenhouse. The greenhouse is a cycle in which can have a huge impact on our environment. If we destroy that then that may result in even more damages that are caused now. It also states, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five days of intensifying smog... In result, the smog then continued to places such as Bejing, China. Which I personally would consider to be a horrific thing, considering China is very congested already and is one of the most pollued cities in the world. Some may argue of the fact that car usage is their main way from going to point A to point B , but there is proof that is effecting the cities around us. Experts have concluded that there is about 50 percent car intensive areas located in the United States. This is why car usage should be reduced to have create a better environment. The suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. The purpose of having denser cities is to have a low suburban life. In source 1 it states, In this new approach , stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather than in malls along some distant highways. This experiment will help to encourage more ways to attempt public transportation. For instance, riding your bicycle once in a blue moon. Not only are you saving money but you are preventing less traffic from occurring in your area. Some may argue having a low suburban life can be hard to adapt to but it will provide a safer environment. Especially since you are one step closer to making the world less polluted then it already is. I personally would agree on occasionally using a different way to get to my destination. It will not only benefit me in the long run but also cause less chaos on the road. It also states in the text, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced communties, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. This means that the Environmental Agency are starting to promote reducing car in certain communities. Some may argue why is there a need to reduce the amount of cars in a community ,but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars. If this is so, then this will just have another negative impact of the environment. The purpose of the program is to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages. All in all, the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. Programs are also being created to spread the news of Car Free day. The purpose for Care Free day in Bogota , Columbia is a day you participate in to prevent traffic jams. For example, In source 3 it states, ..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to work during a car free day. This day isn't ment for people who live in Bogota, Colombia but they are trying to influence this tradition in several other countires. Other may agree of this day being pointless , but I can see this having a huge impact on the world. Sooner or later this day will become a tradition not only in several other countries but also in the United States. it also states in source 3, Its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pulltion, said a bussniessman. Especially since it rained on the Car free day this didnt stop nor discourage anyone from participating in the event. The event turned out to be a huge success and reduced the amount of smog that day. In my perspective we are all come together as one to build our community together. It takes more thenone person to have such a huge impact on the world. The goal if to lessen the usage of car to have a positive effect on the environment. The influence of the Car free day is just one step closer to reaching that goal. This will is why programs are being creates to spread the news of Car free day. After looking of the causes and effects of limiting car usage , it all comes down to having a big influence on the world. It takes one area such as Bogota, Columbia to have a huge impact. In our every day lives , our car is our main resource for transportation, but this should change. Not only are you capable of helping to have a postive effect on the environment but so am I. This just shows how if we are all willing to come together as a community, we are capable of creating a healthier environment. This is why the world should influence limiting car usage.\n",

      "Error processing text: The culture of the car has been coming to an end. With many people now choosing to have other forms of transportation. Now in Germany they are making cities where they help banned car usage. In the romantic city of Paris,France they are now starting to banned cars due to the overload of smog. The city of Bogota,colombia is having a special day where they banned cars and see the effect of now having cars for a day. The car usage is now being observed to do damage around the world and due to that now cities all over the world is now banning the car usage. This will help to have a healthier earth and healthier people. The benefits of banning cars is going to help everyone and even our beloved earth. In Germany the people have made a city where they have given up their cars. The city I believe has a better way to maintain a healthy and cleaner environment than other cities in Germany. The banning of cars has been a great success with now people using bikes or walking as their means of transportation. Even though car ownership is permitted,the problem is that there are only two places to park which cost about 40,000 dollars along with your home. The result of that actions is that 70 percent of people do not own a car and 57 percent sold the car to live in the city. One person states When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way says Heidrun Walter. The citizens of this city have been feeling better about having no car you dont have the stress to have to drive you have the calm relaxing time by walking or biking. did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car intensive areas in the United States.The greenhouse gas has been a problem ever since the development of motor power cars. Now that we are able to stop it lets take that chance to help stop the greenhouse gas and to make cleaner and healthier cities. The romantic city of paris is having a bit of a problem its that its beautiful city is now being coveres in smog due to the overuse of cars. now that Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to help clear the air they can't help to notice that when there are fewer cars being operated the smog begins to clear up. The smog has always been a problem for Paris it usually has more smog than in any European country. The article states that Paris has 147 micrograms of perticulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Reuters found. The romantic city of Paris cant be as wonderful if it always has a problem with having too much smog I believ that the cars are the ones to blame for this matter that if the city of paris bans its cars that the smog will decrease and become a the romantic city that it is. The article states that diesel fuel was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western Europe. That means that it is in fact the motor cars that are the ones causeing the overflow of the smog. If the the cars are able to to be banned in paris we will see a drop in the smog and Paris will return to the romantic city that it is. The city of Bogota,Colombia has been celebrating the day without cars for over three years straight. The car free day help leave the streets of the capital city without any traffic jams. One problem of the road that many countries have in their capital city is that they have to many cars because of the tourist and the huge number of people who live there which causes traffic jams leaving cars in the streets for hours on end. They have the same problem in Brazil where they have one of the worlds worst traffic jams in history. The ones who delevoped the car free day was trying to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Someone states in the article It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The stress of having a car in a countries capital can be stressful to some people and that bikeing or walking is a way to help calm someone after a busy day at work. Due to the car free day the city states that uneven, pitted side walks have been replaced by broad,smooth sidewalks, rush hour restirictions have dramatically cut traffic.The car free day i feel is benefitting everyone from getting rid of traffic jams to clearing up the smog. The replacing of cars for bikes and walking is not so much a bad idea if it will help benefit evryone around you. In conclusion, the car culture is now coming to its end. That nations all over the world has seen the great benefits from banning cars. The greatest effects that banning cars has is that they are helping to get rid of air pollution,stress,and the grreenhouse gas. These are all benfits for everyone it helps the ither people beside u and the environment. The romantic city of Paris was covered in smog due to cars. In Germany where they have developed a city where there is no car in sight and has everything within a walking or bike distance. The city of Bogota,Colombia making a holiday that has been going on for three years straight to have no cars for a day. The people have been seeing that the effects of having no car is wonderful and that we should all do it to better ourselves and to better out enivornment.\n",

      "Error processing text: Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone would have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about safety because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce lot of problems we have, and stress. To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amount of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?! no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it. Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say We can also just stop teens from driving.. well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amount of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be lot safer for people to drive. Sadly in lot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 34 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amount of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amount of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more. We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 1020 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away. To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce lot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world. Hopefully you read this and learned lot about the importance of limiting the usage of cars and how it can effect everything.\n",

      "Error processing text: The anachronism that is the electoral college is a system that unfairly represents voters and can possibly lead to catastrophe. The much simpler solution would be election by popular vote where every voter in every state matters rather than the system of the electoral college that discounts many voters opinions. The arguments against popular vote are either illogical or inconsequential and we as a nation should pay no heed. The biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in the states. An example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by the system is expressed in In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner where it is stated that in the 2012 election between rodney and Obama Florida gave all of its electoral votes towards Obama when he only won 61.7 percent of the vote. This method completely exludes the opinion of the minority, that 48.3 percent of people in Florida who didn't vote for Obama got their say taken away, their opinion no longer mattered to the election because all of the electors were given to Obama by a small majority. A second unfairness to the voters is the attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state. In the article written by Bradford Plumer named The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong it is said that in the 2000 election that seventeen states got no attention from the candidates whatsoever. This system gives undeserved attention to a few swing states which will decide the election because of our outdated system of the electoral college. If popular vote was instituted the attention given to voters of all states would be equal as every vote from every state matters. A problem with the electoral college that could possibly outshine the unfairness of it would be the potential for catastrophe that it brings. As is stated in The Indefensible Electoral College Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer the electors presented by the states according to popular vote are not even obliged to vote for the candidate they said they would. Even though this may be a rare occurace a single elector betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of Americans. Another possible disaster would be a tie vote in the electoral college. This situation, as explained in the same article, would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable even to the unfairness of the normal system. This horrible system consists of each state getting one vote for the president which when you consider that some states have many times the population of others means that millions upon millions of people could have the same say a a couple hundred thousands, an injustice unthinkable in our society and one that could be stopped by instituting a popular vote system. The arguments against popular vote presented in In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner are unrealistic, unsupported, or insignificant. The argument presented as Certainty of Outcome says that a dispute over popular vote would be much more common but provides no evidence to support the claim, invalidating it. The article's second argument states that candidates would have more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote were implemented but this entire argument relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it doesn't matter because the same is true of population, no one region has an overwhelming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. The third argument is the most illogical stating that the electoral college's tendency of causing only swing states to matter is actually a good thing because it increases the education of the populations of those states by the increased attention by the candidate, therefore the educated would decide the vote, making it more accurate. This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states. The articles fourth argument is possibly even more deluded than the third, stating that large states get more attention because of the electoral college which balances out the fact that states have hugely varying populations but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote. The electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere. The only argument presented in In Defense of the Electoral College Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner that has any merit is the fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated runoff elections. Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex runoff elections. To support the electoral college one must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence. This evidence can be easily refuted and outwieghed by strong evidence from the opposing side. To support the electoral college you are supporting unfairness and catastrophe and to any reasonable person that is not a very intelligent idea, making the need for popular vote irrefutable.\n",

      "Error processing text: global warming has been said to be a problem for years now. it has been said that we are slowly but surely destroying our ozone layers. and air pollution is for sure one of the main causes. Smog levels have risen substantially and it shows, but there are more and more solutions that are beginning to show. germany definitely has the right approach here. they live in what is pretty much a car free society. in a one square mile city of 5500 people, 70 of them do not have cars. everything in that city is within walking or biking distance so there is no need for one. having a society like this is also very stress relieving in a sense. you no longer have the every day stress of being on a highway or constantly alert for cars, a society like this is for the most part more laid back then a regular one. the amount of exercise is also increased here because you are walking or biking everywhere, you are constantly moving. it is something that every country should take into consideration. the long term effects of pollution will be detrimental to our world and we know that. now is our time to fix that. tail pipe emission accounts for 12 of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 in dense cities in the United States. and after near record breaking pollution in just a matter of days, paris decided to put a partial ban on driving. by doing this congestion in the city was down 60, and by doing this the smog cleared relatively quickly. in this short amount of time that driving was partially banned we were able to see a large decrease in not only pollution but the amount of congestion in a city. not only does this make everyday life safer for every day citizens but improves the living quality of all people by making the air and world cleaner. projects like this are showing multiple benefits and great long term affects, not only for car drivers but for pedestrians that are walking the streets to, if congestion in a busy city is down by that much it makes getting around a lot easier for someone who walksbikesor runs everywhere. i think its crucial for people to understand the upsides to having societies like this. grnated it will be hard to adjust to but the upsides to it will outweigh the cons in the long run. a big thing to look at here in one of the benefits of having a car free society like this is not just the pollution but the exercise rate. as americans we are without a doubt an overweight country and thats obvious. what having something like this would do for us is incredible. even if it was a one day thing to try like Bogota, Colombia. once a year everyday they have what is called a car free day where everyone in the city is restricted from using cars unless it is a taxi or transit. this now enforces or allows if you will, everyone to ride a bike, skate, run, or walk to their destination. the streets are left practically empty. when you also do this you can bring improvements to your community. Bogota went from a cracked unevenly paved sidewalk to the replacement of smooth broad and even sidewalks. parks and sport centers have increased and blossomed all throughout the city, and you see the community just start to come together as a whole. Now with all this being said there obviously are still downsides to cutting out gas producing cars. weather being a main one. suppose it rains one day, how do you get to work? not only that but in warmer climates if you have to go a longer distance to get to your job it gets hot and if you are in your suit and tie you're going to be sweating. if you are a blue collar worker, you have equipment that you have to keep on you at all times not having a vehicle will restrict that. not being able to drive will also slow down many buisnesses that travel to someones home such as a lawn service or a plumber. if you work out of town how do you get to your job? people would have to leave their families and move closer to their workplace if they worked out of town or quit their job. there is a lot to take into consideration when you think about all the possibilities of creating a society like this. and the only way this could work is if it was incorporated the same way that it was for Vauban germany. if you had a one square mile society where everything was walking distance and your job was in the area then i believe it would be extremely beneficial, but areas like that are few and far between and making areas like that would change the geography of the entire country. by no means are we as a country America ready to change to this kind of society any time soon, but i do think that in due time we can benefit from this in a huge way. but there is a lot that has to change and our nation as a whole has to be willing to conform to this. there would be a substancial amount of change in this nation if this were to happen and we as a country are not one that necessarily likes change. we like our two car white pickett fence houses and cutting that out of everyones lives would no go over well with the majority of Americans. this is something that the future of America needs to seriously take into consideration. its appearant that we are destroying our world every single day and we are one of the main contributors.\n",

In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its' streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this carfree city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an anticar revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever growing carfree city club by starting a program that sponsors a carfree day once a year. Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emersed into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its' residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the contructions of highways and such. When reading the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragragh 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation. Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnessasary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog by Robert Duffer in paragragh 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate driving completely so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illiminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its' citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether or not it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty two euro fine. According to the article titled Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog by Robert Duffer in paragragh 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illiminated in Paris after that week. After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogota, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article CarFree Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogota by Andrew Selskey in paragragh 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogota in the mid1990s according to the article titled CarFree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogota by Andrew Selsky in paragrapgh 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogota have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicyce paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city. Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article The End Of Car Culture by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable and seem to take more time then to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used and is needed than most people in America seem to take to carpooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.\n",

      "Error processing text: Ever since cars were invented, they have widely been used as the primary source of transportation. They became so commonplace that their widespread use started to introduce negative impacts. As a result, some countries, or cities, have recently put in place programs or events to limit, or decrease, the amount of car usage in that area. There are many advantages to limiting car usage, including that not using cars is better for the environment and that it allows the city to improve itself. In recent years, the environment has become a worldwide concern one of the advantages to limiting car usage is that it will positively impact the environment. Today, people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, she writes, Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, Paris bans driving due to smog. According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with evennumbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with oddnumbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with oddnumbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one. Additionally, the limited use of cars opens many opportunities for cities to improve themselves by adding new features or improving upon old ones. In the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the cityuneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars. She writes, While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself. There are many advantages to limiting car use. Not only does it improve the environment by removing smog and reducing greenhouse gas emission, but it also allows the area to improve itself by building new features. For this reason, limited car use should be seen as an overall positive idea.\n",

      "Error processing text: Have you ever seen a smog cloud before? Or even been a city that has a really high level of it? It's typically caused by the vehicles, and how much that they're used in the area that you happened to be in. There are some places that have days where your not aloud to drive. There are some places that people don't even own cars, and places where people only go by bus, bike, car pooling, or train. But there is one thing we notice about all of these people, and the places that they live in when they have people consistently going by other means, and not using their car. It's been a problem that has been up in the air for the longest time, and people are starting to do something about it, and probably without even knowing it. The city of Vauban, Germany is pretty normal. it consist of normal homes, normal people, and just normal everyday life. Except for two things. vaughn's streets are completely carfreeexcept the main thoroughfare paragraph 2, Source 1. Even if you owned a car, there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for fortythousand dollars, along with a home paragraph 2, Source 1. The other crazy thing about this town is that Vauban is home to five thousandfive hundred residents within a rectangular square mile paragraph 6, Source 1. Their town is free of the green house emissions that are caused by passanger cars. It's there way of smart planning, and other cities are starting to try to find ways to become cleaner, and better at being somehow like Vauban. People here say that it reduces the stress of driving, and traffic jams, and makes life simply easier by not driving. But imagine if you were banned from driving in a place where you were used to driving everyday. Paris decided that after days of nearrecord pollution, they would enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city paragraph 10, Source 2. some 4,000 drivers were given a fine of thirtyone dollars, and there were twentyseven cars impounded due to disobeying the ban. however, after 5 days of this ban going in to effect, Congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of france paragraph 14, Source 2. The people driving isn't really the problem, it's the fact that France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline paragraph 16, Source 2 and they're saying that becuase it makes up such a higher percentage of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that it's causing their smog levels to go up higher as well. Gradually the smog lifted off of the city of paris, and they were finally able to start letting certain amounts of cars back on the road without fines. There are some places that they have days that are car free? In the LatinAmerican city of Bogota, they have a day that's carfree. Millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work paragraph 20, Source 3. They only face a small fine of twentyfive bucks if they decide to drive, but msot people don't have to worry if they don't have a bike or don't want to walk. Buses and taxis are still aloud on the roads. Even on the days where gray clouds dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota, the rain hasn't stopped people from participating paragraph 2223, Source 3. It's not just 5,500 people who don't do it, there are seven million people in the capital city who don't drive. It's been going on since the 1990s. The city has planned, and made efforts to have these days so that they can also take part in the reductin of the emiisions of green house gases. The city has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths and uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth ones paragraph 2728, Source 3. Many places are trying to encorporate designs in to their cities to do these things, and to become better at traveling in means other than your personal vehicle. but even without our knowledge, people are starting to limit car usage without being told to, it's just inch by inch. People are beggingin to drive less, and America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling paragraph 32, Source 4. however in the past few years, americans have bught fewer cars, and the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has dropped steadily therafter paragraph 32, Source 4. reseachers are intrigued that car ownership per household had gone down, three to four years before they noticed this. This pattern continuing, which they believe it will, would have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment paragraph 34, Source 4. Other odd things have changed too. There has been a large drop in the percentage of sixteen to thirtynine year olds gettign a license. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased twentythree percent between 20012009 paragraph 41, Source 4. Plans are being put in action to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, and to put more ways into cities for people to travel alternatively to their normal going by car. The way that we're building cities, new suburbs, and things like that are beginning to incorporate other ideas from around the world to help not just everyone including yourself, but also the enviroment itself. Meeting new people really isn't all that bad, and traveling by bus, train, transit, taxi, car pooling, bicycling, tram, trolley, walking, skating or even the interesting inventions we see by people all the time. There are many different ways that you can avoid having to drive your own car. It isn't a hassle. It's also a stress reliever, and helps you not get worried about how your going to avoid that five o'clock rush hour traffic jam that you have to sit and yell at people in. Not only does it probably save you money not having to buy gas every couple of days, it also helps you and the enviroment. Breathing cleaner air helps you to live longer than breathing air that has all that smog, and nastiness in the air. Your city is only a step in a new direction, and it's only a matter of how you want to do it. There's optoins, like you hear in the insruance commercials, that you can take and be just fine. There's a lot of advantages to the limiting of car uses, and the carfree days. It's just on you whether or not you want to take that route, make a change in your daily habit, and find that simple way to limit your car usage.\n",

      "Error processing text: Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. Therefore, a revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world using personal automobiles less. The new aspect of using cars less has promoted a happier society, a cleaner environment, and an open attitude towards alternative transportation. First of all, by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stressfree. The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this carfree community when she states, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way Rosenthal. By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual carfree day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the carfree day is a good opportunity to take away stress... Selsky. As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude. With a smaller amount of people using their personal vehicles, less gas emissions are becoming a part of the Earth's atmosphere. Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are responsible for 12 percent Rosenthal. This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions Chicago Tribune. To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth. Last, declining the use of cars creates an open attitude towards alternative transportation methods. Those who live in carfree communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will carpool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to get where they needed to be Selsky. Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends Rosenthal. Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world. In conclusion, a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stressfree society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.\n",

      "Error processing text: Ever wondered how the streets of a very populated city would look like? For example, Miami. At night Miami is full buildings that stand out in color, and on the highways you can see a whole road full of lights, the thing with these lights is that they are cars, even though they are helpful by getting us from point A to point B, they are the second highest source of pollution in the United States, that is after power plants. The only thing a city like Miami is missing at night is a sky full of bright stars, which that can be done by people not driving to everywhere they go, even if it is one or two blocks away. This whole carfree thing is become more and more popular all over the world. In Vauban, Germany a small town, home to 5,500 people have decided to go carfree. As a result, 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here Source 1. 70 percent of the the people is a lot, these streets are completly carfree except in the main thoroughfare and on the edge of the community, if this were to happen to a larger city the nights would be beautiful, and so will the days because you have all the car noise out and instead you have people talking and kids running all around the streets. passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States source 1. Miami is a carintensive area, I know this from personal experience, there is always traffic during the day. I've been to other places in Florida, not that far from Miami, in Palm Beach at night the amount of starts you see at nights is beautiful and it's something new to see other than in Miami you see 2 to 3 stars. My point here isn't stars, it's how much better the world can be if we all do what this small town in Germany is doing. Paris, France. The city of lights home to millions of residents and a landmark for millions of tourists, one would think this city couldn't run without cars, but they made it happen. Paris wanted to clean all the air polution in their city, On Monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31 Source 2. Even though some didn't listen and about 4,000 drivers were fined, that is still very little compared to the entire population of Paris. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog Source 2. Can you believe that? Traffic was down by 60 perfect in the city of lights, if it can happen there it can happen all around the world, little by little bu we'll get it. Public transportation was free of charge in the city while this carfree thing was going on. One week later the smog had cleared out enough for the ruiling French party to rescind the ban. BOGOTA, Colombia In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams Source 3. Yes, the city of Bogota in Colombia had its one carfree day, in Bogota called Day Without Cars, this was the third year actually, on this carfree day cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted for the day. Bogota was not the only Colombian city to participate in this event, other Colombian cities like Cali and Valledupr, participated in this event for the first time. I find it funny and ironic because my sister has a friend who is Colombian and she owns a bicycle and she goes everywhere in that bicycle, and she refuses to get a car. Bogota is a very known city and just like I said before, if they can do it then the whole world can it. This day should be world wide and should be done at leats twice a year. Events like this will also get people motivated to start walking morre often. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up Source 3. If you've ever been to Miami, you know the huge amount of building there are here and I think there are about 3 or 4 being built at I type, how about we stop there and make Miami and healthier and more environmentally friendly place. In the United States, research shows A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 Source 4. This meaning that adolescents aren't as intresting and driving as they were before, yeah I see how driving can be better but most kids here take the bus, they aren't even driven by their parents anymore. I find that this is a good thing because, one can ask themselves, I can't make a difference, but if thousands of people ask themselves that, then yes a difference can be made. In 2005 the miles driven by Americans peaked, and then steadily went dropping, in April, 2013 they found out that the miles in car was the same as it was in 1995. Not driving everywhere you go and actually walking there is a good thing because you can make new friends, and health wise it is also good because, instead of walking around your block for an hour, you can walk to someones house or to the store. There are several carpooling apps on the internet nowadays, if your friends can't pick you up, for just a push of a button you can have someone come pick you up to where ever you are and drop you off where you need to go to, for a low price. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by Source 4. This means that people aren't as interest in driving anymore, which means we are slowly getting near the time where we'll see more stars in the sky in carintensive areas.\n",

      "Error processing text: To the State Senate, Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popularbased vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fulfilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors 3. This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. The Electoral College is a process, not a place Office of the Federal Register, 1. This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well. According to Plumer, Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote 2. This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters 2. This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states... 2. This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winnertakeall system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. It's official The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational Plumer,2. This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed. Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid RunOff Elections... Posner, 3. These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winnertakesall method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution... 3. In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Runoff Elections, Posner states that, The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast 3. I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking. In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swingstates are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America.\n",

      "Error processing text: Have you ever realized how driving everywhere isn't always the best way to get places? Well, there are a few advantages of limiting car usage for fellow citizens. Think about it, cars aren't all that great, yeah they get you to your destination much faster than, let's say walking or maybe even riding a bike, but that isn't always a good thing. Bikes and walking are so much easier than driving everywhere because in order to drive to your destination you must have gasoline in your vehicle. If you were to walk to your specific destination you will not only get exercise but you can also walk with a friend, it will give you time to hang out with others and be social! Limiting car usage will also limit the amount of accidents on the roads everyday. It will end the texting and driving situation throughout the streets. The less people driving the safer the ones that do drive will be. People don't realize what cars do that are bad, all of us only see the good in vehicles because we don't want to have to push ourselves to change for the better. Oh my! 2.56 for a gallon of gasoline will add up very quickly! That isn't the only gasoline that is affecting people either, there is also greenhouse gas from cars driving by. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... Source 1 In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars IGS Paragraph 5 Line 34. The greenhouse gas percentage has gotten very high going from Europe to the United States, it is getting quite out of hand if you ask me. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Source 1 IGS Paragraph 5 Lines 46. Prices on gasoline stand very high now a days and it is bringing people downhill because the higher the price the less money they begin to have until they can't go out anymore. In result to trying to solve the pollution of gasoline problem the fined who ever it was that was causing the situation. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters... Twentyseven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog PBDS Paragraph 12 Lines 13. I believe that every country, state and city should take at least one day out of the year and make it a no driving day. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Source 2 PBDS Paragraph 10 Lines 12. If we do the same as Paris we can clear the air and not worry about the pollution as much but there are still other disadvantages for car usage. Lifting weights? Joining a gym? Those are all good ways to get your exercise but really you could just get in the habit of walking to wear you need to go and get more exercise than you would in the gym. While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. Source 1 IGS Paragraph 6 Lines 13. Making the cities denser will mean that the citizens who live in them can walk to the stores and resturaunts down the street instead of driving. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Source 1 IGS Paragraph 6 Lines 810. Not to mention the traffic while driving! Walking to your destination will make getting places so much more afficient because you won't have to be late to a meeting or even work at that matter if it is walking distance. Congestion car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog... Source 2 PBDS Paragraph 14 Lines 12. If there are less cars on the street and more people on the sidewalks, the world wouldn't be so gloomy. No one is social anymore, they don't care for others they only care for themselves and that is very wrong. If the limit of car usage decreases, the more people will want to walk and be social with others. Watch out for that....! crash! Safety is so important when you are driving, accidents happen so quickly and if you aren't careful it could be you. This is another reason why limiting car usage is a rather good idea because it will cause accidents to happen less often than they do now. Car accidents happen everyday, maybe to a complete stranger or to someone you know, either way walking is safer. In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carfree day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Source 3 Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota CFDB Paragraph 20 Lines 14. Walking to places is more, what's the word I'm looking for..? Oh! Walking is more social and safe, if you took one whole day without using your car, you could walk and as others catch on to why you are walking they will begin to walk along with you and you will develop the idea that walking is more fun and safe than driving. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new resturaunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Source 3 PBDS Paragraph 28 Lines 14. More people will begin to go out and walk for fun after getting in the habit of going with you and you can enjoy the world so much more knowing that the air isn't being as polluting and there won't be a many car accidents. You will save yourself and whoever follows through with you to limit the usage or cars and other vehicles. Get a few of your friends together and go for a bike ride to the mall! There are some advantages of limiting car usage. Being in your car, whether it be alone or with others, is quite boring. You get to places very quickly but also don't have the experience that you could if you try something different. Try walking to the mall or a resturaunt not so close to you and bring some of your friends, see if you have more of a good time walking than you would driving. Driving is too expensive, you need to pay insurance to drive as well as paying to get gasoline. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. Source 4 The End Of Car Culture TEOC Paragraph 36 Lines 12. People are beginning to realize that cars are not all that great and don't do good for the world, they pollute the air we breathe. The less people to drive the better our cities will be, they will start to have less pollution in the air, less car accidents and more exercise to walk and bike to where you need to be. Be the one to make the clear the air day, and be a role model, show others why you decided to limit car usage.\n",

      "Error processing text: Vroom, vroom goes the 1998 Chevy Impala next to you at the stop light. Driving has become apart of culture that is standard to the developed world. But the culture is slowly changing because the driving epidemic is becoming limited. Cars can be very expensive, harmful to the environment, and troublesome. Limiting car usage can help the environment, help finances, and reduce stress. Cars are defined as metal cases with leather seats powered by gas or diseal. Gas and diesel are fuels that are harmful to the Earth and can cause harmful emission and greenhouse gases. These gasses can cause smog, or smoke and fog mixed together creating a grey cloud of unbreathable dense air. Smog is very harmful for the environment and can heat the Earth which is not the ideal for the human body. In France, smog, caused by car emissions became unbearable, thus causing the entire city of Paris to ban cars for five days. According to Robert Duffer, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog Paris Bans Driving due to Smog Paragraph 14. Therefore cars and its horrible blow can cause a blanket of harmful reactant. Cars can also cause greenhouse gases which is when the heat of the day and the cool of the night trap in the harmful emissions of a car. These greenhouse gases can also heat the Earth and can harm humans. Elisabeth Rosenthal states, Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States CarFree Cities Paragraph 5. In effort to save the Earth and the human race many cities and communities have adopted carbanning, reducing the amount of population caused buy cars. A 2014 Lincoln MKX runs about 45,000, which is the equivalent to the salary of a high school teacher annually. Cars can be very expensive to buy, maintain, and to fuel. The price of oil is about 2.45 today. But over the past few years gas prices have fluctuated up to almost 4.00 a gallon. The average driver might buy gas every two weeks at 20 gallons, that equals 116 a month for gas. The money used to fuel the car has turned into a gas bill, not to mention the sparatic mishaps that can happen while on the road. Cars today have become an investment instead of a luxury. Although, transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, does not mean it should remain. The advance in technology and resources has allowed people to reduce the use of cars, and ultimately save themselves money. For example, many people have coworkers that live near one another. Thus, both persons can carpool on alternate days. Mimi Sheller suggests, the Internet makes telecommunting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends End of Car Culture Paragraph 35. It is much easier and cheaper to carpool, take the bus, or take the subway. Limiting car usage would save money because more young people are interestedin driving, but it's not a prority. Therefore, parents do not have to spend 30,000 on a new car for their 16 year old. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, which is putting money back into the pockets of parents and public transportation companies The End of Car Culture Paragraph 39. Road rage is the disease the that overtakes a person when another person is driving idiotically. Road rage is sitting at a green light at a complete stop because the person in front of you is too busy texting their BFF. Road rage is caused by driving. Driving can cause stress because cars are out of your control, traffic is out of your control, and time is out your control. When things are out of control, human nature is to panic. Driving is not the time nor the place to panic. Limiting car usage can reduce the effects of this stress caused by driving because there would be less people on the road, less traffic, and less crashes. Heidrun Walter says, When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way Car Free Cities Paragraph 3. Less cars means less drivers which then means a safer environment for pedestrians. Less cars means less traffic which means no more road rage. Less cars means less cars because there are less reckless drivers grazing the road. Limiting car usage can also make people come closer together because it forces them to interact in order to get around. For instance, instead of hopping into you 2013 Camry you call an old friend who happens to work on a different floor of your office building. This interaction can spark a new realtionship and brightens your day. Cars and driving causes stress because it is out of control, but if cars are limited then the stressed caused by driving will be reduced. Road rage, smog, and tickets, driving is the mush pot of the many problems of this world. Limiting car usage can save the planet, save money, and save you blood from boiling. The priviledge of driving has been taken advantage of and has caused the world to decay at its own expense. The human race has the ability remit from the tragdey of cars one city at a time.\n",

      "Error processing text: Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite. To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states. As you know, tossup state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group Democratic or Republic. Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the candidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he or she is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take rodney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. rodney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really their president. However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a winnertakeall system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president. Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. This quote shows that the candidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man or woman might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.\n",

      "Error processing text: Many cities are experiencing perhaps the biggest economic change being implemented into society since the invention of the Model T. People just simply aren't interested in attaining a personal vehicle, or even a license for that matter. As a result, many personal vehicle companies are starting to become more mobile to stay with the times, or become bankrupt due to being stagnant in sales. Not owning a car has actually proved to come with more advantages than if owning a car. Such as, less carbon emissions in the air, less stress in certain communities where carfree zones are being implemented, and finally restaurants and stores becoming more cropped up due to rushhour restrictions essentially boosting the economy. The lack of car use has fundamentally benefitted the environment as an entirety. Cars emit carbon emissions into the air that are not only harmful to many animals, but to humans as well. According to Source 2, in Paris, France alone, it was shown that due to the use of diesel fuel over regular fuel, there were 147 micrograms of particle matter per cubic meter. Comparing this to other major cities in Europe that find more use for regular gasoline, you'll find that the results are less. In Brussels, there were 114 micrograms of PM per cubic meter, and in London, 79.7. Even though areas that used more regular fuel over diesel fuel were significantly lower in micrograms of particle matter, even 79.7 micrograms can be potentially fatal, and cause lungrelated health problems in the later lives of the people occupying these areas. Officials not only in Paris, but also in major cities such as Bogota, Colombia and New York City, New York have also began to take a stand. In Paris, France for example, there are certain days in which cars cannot be driven by people with license plates ending in even numbers, and the next day by people with license plates ending in odd numbers. This new way of thinking has been implemented into the French law system to help decrease the amount of pollution in the air. Source 2 Bogota has also found a unique approach to a less polluted environment. Carfree day is a day in which no cars are driven, with the exception of buses and taxis. Source 3 Finally, New York City has implemented a new bikesharing program in which bicycles can be rented for a costeffective amount. In addition to this, bridge and tunnel tolls have also reflected these new priorities by skyrocketing in price. Source 4 These new implementations have proved beneficial in decreasing the amount of carbon emissions in the air. Many communities have not only found a way to reduce pollution in the air, but also live a more stressfree lifestyle. Stress and rushhour are known to have some corollation, but newer communities are starting to take a stand by limiting the amount of car usage in their area. Vauban, Germany, a newer community only just established in 2006, is an example of one of these communities that has started to smart plan. Over 70 percent of Vauban's occupants don't own a car, and 57 percent have sold a car to move there. Source 1 A happier lifestyle has appeared as a result. According to Heidrun Walter, an occupant in Vauban. When she had a car, she was always tense. But now, she's a much happier mother of two, and the distant hum of an occasional motor vehicle is drowned out by the chattering of wandering children. Source 1 In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency EPA is suggesting that we start implementing these car reduced communities in our nation to better society, as well as to provide a more stressfree environment for these new communities' residents. Source 1 Even in Bogota, people have said that the use of no cars is a great opportunity that has taken away stress and lowered air pollution. Source 3 Not only has pollution been reduced in all of this or the fact that a factor attributing to stress has also been removed, but areas where these communities are starting to form, have also boosted the economy. In Bogota, it has been reported that due to Carfree day, that both parks and sports centers have started to appear throughout the city. In additon to this, sidewalks have been replaced by more broad, smooth sidewalks. As well as, rushhour traffic has been cut, allowing new restaurants and upscale shopping districts to flourish. Source 3 Cars are starting to become a thing of the past, according to Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University. Even her children 19 and 21 don't have licenses. They say they're interested, but it's not a priority for them, she later goes on to say. As a result, gas money is saved, and people can spend more money on things that matter to them. In conclusion, it has been displayed that the advantages of not using a car are starting to outweight the benefits. The lack of car use in these carfree communities is helping to reduce stress and tension on the road, boost not only the community's economy, but also the entire nation's economy as well. In addition to this, the lack of car use is also helping to preserve the environment, by reducing carbon emissions into the air. According to many sociologists and business professionals, the downfall of the car may well be on its way, but it may not be such a bad thing.\n",

      "Error processing text: Here in America, with our broad expanses and suburban ideals Rosenthal, para. 3, the automobile is the way in which we move it takes us to school, to the office, to our homes, to the homes of others, to distant, unexplored places. Entire buildings and businesses are dedicated to this wonderful invention. However, as American culture shifts and we focus less and less on the car itself, the advantages to limiting our use of this tool become increasingly evident less polluted air, more costfriendly alternatives, and the bonding of whole communities. This turnaway from a carfocused society could certainly change the American perspective on the automobile industry as a whole. Cars, despite some of their clear advantages, cannot provide the necessary advantage of lesspolluted air. Automobiles in the United States can produce up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in carintensive regions European passenger cars can produce up to 12 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Europe Rosenthal without cars, these greenhouse gas rates dramatically drop. One example of this is the temporary ban of driving a car in Paris due to recordbreaking smog levels. According to an article by Robert Duffer, Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog, and that colder nighttime weather and warmer daytime weather caused the warmer air to trap car emissions. People from other countries also seem to be enthusiastic about limited car use and its effects. Carlos Arturo Plaza of Bogota, Colombia, who participated in his city's 3rd annual Day Without Cars, says that 'It's a good opportunity to...lower air pollution Selsky. In our own country, as Americans buy less cars and register for less driver's licenses, sociologists can conclude that it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants Rosenthal, para.6. A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will allow cleaner air, which could eventually lead to healthier living standards across the globe, as well as healthier and more diverse ecosystems and biomes. With the limited use of cars, this could all be a possibility. Not only will this restriction of car use allow for less air pollution, it could also lead to producing more costfriendly methods of transportation. Cars and their accessories are often expensive to maintain and to purchase, so the creation of other ways to get around are a must to those who cannot afford such maintenance or purchases. In a passage by Andrew Selsky, he states that Bogota's Day Without Cars has allowed for the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, along with broad, smooth sidewalks, to travel on. In the booming and populous city of New York, its bikesharing program and skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls Rosenthal allow the world to see the shift towards cheap yet affective alternatives to transportation. Michael Sivak, research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute, has a son who uses Bay Area Rapid Transit, even though it often takes longer than driving, simply because it is cheaper and a car is simply not a priority Rosenthal. Alternative transportation is definitely on the rise as car usage becomes less and less of a trend. While all of these advantages to limited car use affect us all, the one that will most directly and immediately affect people is the bonding of whole communities. When car use is reduced, there is more opportunity for interaction with others, whether it be through modern technology such as the cellphone or social media, or through facetoface communication as seen in a good oldfashioned conversation between two people. Various factors, according to Mimi Sheller, professor at Drexel Unviersity, are accountable for this community bond the Internet, which allows for connection with people without driving to meet them the renewal of center cities to draw in empty nesters Sheller, Rosenthal as well as carpooling apps and services. Vauban, an entirely carfree suburb in Germany, has adopted a nocar policy in an attempt to separate suburban life and automobile use, an asset in a new project known as smart planning. This separation allows its citizens to have more personal interaction, with its businesses being a short walk from their homes and less space to park a personal automobile. This compacted suburban example in distant Germany is also being adopted in some places in America as well, and it may eventually be the future of American suburb life. With these changes come more and more opportunity to delve a deeper connection with the citizens who live in your area. America has long been pictured as one of the world's prime car cultures Rosenthal. It's the home of many famous and renowned automobiles, including the Ford Model T and Detroit, Michigan, where Chrysler automobiles are manufactured and exported all over the globe. However, as the United States evolves into a different sort of country, so does its focus on the car. Restricting use of the car offers up many advantages to its citizens less greenhouse gas emissions, more costfriendly options to transportation, and the opportunity to bond with your community. As the American Dream continues to change, so will the way in which we move.\n",

      "Error processing text: Dear Senator, Many people might agree theat we shouldn't have an Electoral College at all, since most of thee time it doesn't seem to work at all since of instead just voting on thee person or candidate you would prefer, you instead vote for a slate of electors instead of thee preferred candidate. This is not thee case, however, and in fact, thee Electoral College does seem to function. It can be proven in two simple reasons on why thee Electoral College still works certainty of outcome and thee simple fact theat it's everyone's president. Foremost, thee certainty of outcome can easily prove why thee Electoral College still works. If we even do go to a system where we actually vote for popular vote, it would work as well as we do right now withe thee Electoral College, since theere will be more disputes on popular vote thean on thee Electoral College. In Richard A. poster's article on thee defense for thee Electoral College, he states in his first reason on why theeir would be much dispute over popular vote thean on thee Electoral College, and why it's less likely to happen on a Electoral College. He states The reason is theat thee winning candidate's share of thee Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of thee popular vote. It's true, after all theat thee Electoral College's votes exceed over thee popular votes. It could be also said theat even if thee government actually switches to popular vote, we know it would work since it does not exceed how on Electoral College votes go, which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. On anotheer note, in some cases, theere can be ties between two candidates, as seen in 1992's Election between Nixon and Clinton on thee popular vote. To summarize, thee certainty of outcome is far greater in thee Electoral College ratheer thean thee popular vote due to sheer number of votes in thee Electoral College. On a second note, thee fact theat thee american people can vote enough theat it's everyone's president is anotheer reason on why thee Electoral college does work. The Electoral College works by havng thee winner win transregionally ratheer thean just focus on just on region theat just favors theem and only theem. So instead of one region getting thee candidate theat prefers and focuses on only theem, everyone can have a candidate theat will focus largely on thee nation's issues ratheer thean just a specific part ot thee country. For example, let's say theat thee largest population of people in a regon in thee United States is thee southe not saying it is or isn't, it's just an example. The southe is mainly republican, so theey will only vote for a republican theat will focus majorly on thee southe. It is unfair for thee rest of thee regions, such as thee Northeeast, Middle, Pacific, and otheer regions of thee United States, since theey are mainly democratic not really, it is used as an example who would want focus on theeir region as well, too. In Bradford plumber's article on why thee Electoral College should be gone, he states theat thee electoral college is unfair to voters, since most candidates did not botheer withe thee states theey know theey have no chance of winning at all. There could be an easy counter argument against theis, since theose states have probably already made up theeir minds on who to vote for, like a democratic candidate visiting Texas where it's mainly republican, theey know who Texas is going to vote for, theere is no use in trying to convince theem when theey have already made up theeir minds, same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince thee democratic California, theey already know theere is no use in reasoning and convincing when someone has already made up theeir mind. Also, someone can easily counterattack most of thee arguments brought up in the plumber's article, since theis was written before thee 2004 election, and it has been a decade already, plenty of theings could've changed during thee course if ten years in politics. In order to make a greater argument against thee electoral college, one must have an updated list of facts in order to back it up, as certain theings could've changed during a certain course of a decade. During thee course of a decade, we seen how affective thee electoral college was during thee 2004 elections people who disagreed during thee 2004 elections and also agree theat thee electoral college doesn't work at all have to see thee events theat transpired before thee 2004 elections and thee promises made before it also, thee 2008 elections again, if thee people disagreed on how thee electoral college worked at theat time, you would need to look at how people saw change during theat time and thee amount of younger citizens voting at theat time, and thee 2012 elections as well also again, if disagreeing withe thee electoral college is reasonable at theat time, you would need to look at how people reacted at theat time and how different events before thee election affected thee outcome. In a final note, thee electoral college is thee vote on thee people's president is true, and witheholds it since it can focus on ratheer thean on one specific region, but thee nation as a whole. In summarization, thee electoral college should be kept due to thee simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and thee voting on thee people's president. The reasoning of certainty of outcome can be applied here is due to thee simple fact theat thee votes for thee electoral college are far more greater thean thee votes for popular vote, same goes to thee voting on thee people's president, since it focuses on thee entire nation ratheer theat just one region of thee country. Senator, we should be able to keep our electoral college, as it proves effective during thee recent elections, and can certainly prove itself useful and reliable during thee next elections to come.\n",

      "Error processing text: Many countries world wide have gone carfree due to either smog or other areas has simply banned them. Not only is banning cars good for the environment it is also good for the well being of the human race. In the following passages In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Paris bans driving due to smog, Carfree day is a big hit in Bogota, and The End of Car Culture mention the finner points about why being carfree is beneficial. By far, Europe is once again ahead of the United States due to the fact that many countries dont use cars, but they travel to their next destination by train, tram, bus, and walikng. Unlike America, almost every one is using a car to get to their next place, and barely use a bus. According to the passage The End of Car Culture our own president of the United States is making goals to help improve the greenhouse gas emissions but just like the title suggest the end of cars are near. The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures researchers are noticing a decline in the buying and selling of cars nation wide. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.It has already accelerated in Europes biggest capitals the world has come to know and love. Paris. The city of love or the city of smog, has banned driving due to record high reports of smog. After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city according to the passage Paris bans driving due to smog smog in the city of love is not quite romantic as a city without smog. Paris alone ... had 147 micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter.... Banning cars and fining people is one way to help clear the air of pollution, so their is more room for love, laughter, and happiness. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. well maybe the smog and love can share the air. Lets travel all the way back to the Americas to see how the smog is doing there in the countyr of Colombia. Bogota, Colombia located in South America has had its own little smog problems just like Paris. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. a whole day of either biking, hiking, skating, walking,or taking a taxi andor bus, to get to work or school. In the Passage Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota explains to us why we should stop using cars but rather rely on our body than a 3,000 pound peice of machinerery. The days without cars is part of an imporvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s.. For almost 25 years Bogota, Colombia once a year celebrates a day to help reduce smog, and produce a happy, healthy, and smog free life style. 'The rain hasnt stopped people from participating,' remarks Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. there may have been a few gray clouds, but that doesnt keep people form not supporting their own environment. Good Job to Bogota, and see what tricks Germany has up their sleeve. Picture this an upscale suburban community in Vauban, Germany where soccer moms are taking there children to soccer practice, and big CEO executives are going to work. They're getting to their next destination not by car, because in this town of 5,500 people, nobody has a car because they have give up the life of Car Culture. The passage In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, well truely they do. Who needs cars when you go to work by bike, train, skateboard, roller skates, or the traditional walking. Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called 'smart planning.' What amkes this smart planning truely genius, is that everbody is totally cool with it. For the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs.... Vauban may be just an experimental suburb, but the people who live in it seem to enjoy the life without the hastle of smog producing vehicles. When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way. states Heidrum walter, a resident of the green suburban town Vaubran. Many countries world wide have gone carfree due to either smog or maybe even banned them entirely. Countries all over the wolrd are seeing a difference in their community every day when they don't drive a car. not only is going carfree great for the reduction of smog, but you can live a happier, healthier, and stressfree life style like most people have noitced from Bogota, Colombia to the small suburban town Vauban, Geramny. Next time when you leave your house for work, just think how stressfree you'll be if you biked, walked, or take the train.\n",

      "Error processing text: when looking at the world from a birds eye view, it is possible to see the beauty in the world Even so, in certain developed and developing areas, the people are choking. The choking is not just supported by the violated environment, but along with that, society is an advocate for the pain of the people. An intrugal part of the current society is the usage of cars. With the progressing world also comes regress, and according to an article written by the New york times in 2013, it was stated that in countries such as the United states of America, Americans are buying less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. This eventually has lead to a limiting in car usage in the U.S.A. Although the car industry may suffer from this, it is essential to note that, the limiting in car usage does not really have a negative impact on the public. In fact, in the long run, the limiting of car usage will be beneficial to society as a whole. This can be seen in three major ways, with first, public benefits , second, cheaper and timesaving methods , and finally the unmatched environmental benefits. As people continue to choke from the pain, it becomes important to identify the remedy to the problem, and limiting car usage is the definitely one of the best ways to reduce the harms. The public benefits can be broken down into reduced stress , more space , and increased safety. Starting off with stress, Heidrun Walter, a mother of two children stated that she was always tense when she had a car. she now lives in the German city of Vauban. Here most people have given up on cars, including Mrs. Walter. As a mother of two she ultimately is a strong advocate of car usage limitation. With Mrs. Walter, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated that It's a good opportunity to take away stress. These people have already felt their stress decrease with the limitation of car usage and this is a major benefit. Moving toward space, an article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal in 2009, states in this new approach, we will have make it so there is less space for parking. With less space for cars, there is more space for people. Not only that but with the increased limit, there is a decrease in traffic. Traffic can be extremely long, and in this case it will help to increase public space. Although traffic does not pose threats to the people safety, in the long term car accidents do pose a major threat. Therefore, with their limit, there can be an increase in safety for the people. Moving back to Mrs. Walter, she as a mother of two did want the best for her children, and above all comes their safety. Meaning that her choice can also reflect the safety that this limitation produces. Although people do want to benefit as individuals, it really comes down to the cost at the end point. But limiting car usage is actually not that expensive to the average person. In fact, by limiting cars, alternate transportation is promoted. Countries such as Colombia, have move on to bicycles. The major of Bogotaa city in colombia said that due to the limitation of cars for a day It has seen the constuction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. This is cheaper because the prices og bicycles are pale in comparison to cars. This means that transport would be so much more affordable. Now with the increase in bicycle travel, there would hardly be any large amounts of traffic. And although cars are much faster than bicycles, the fact that traffic will be a major factor in travel, bicycle travel will be more efficient. This ultimately means that by limiting car usage, transportation will be cheaper, and it will be just as efficient, if not more. It can be said that it would be difficult to manage bicycle travel, but David Goldberg, an offical of transportation for America said that in countries such as the U.S.A. 80 of appropriations have gone to highways. This ultimately sets the stone for the construstion of these lanes. By limiting car usage, these appropriations can be set aside for other means of transportation. Indeed in the end Vauban is correct in calling this smart planning. Now comes out the benefits everyone knows about the environmental benefits. Smog has been one of the largest problems that is choking the people around the world. In countries such as China, it is elementary that those people as facing large amounts of smog, daily. But what may not be as common to people is that a country such as France has also started to see a similiar problem. Pollution in France is actually rivaled by Beijingone of the most polluted countries in the world as reported by the Chicago tribune on 2014. Cars have been the major cause of this, considering the fact that a large amount of carbon emission were sent out by cars. In fact an article named The end of car culture states that cars are one of the highest sources for carbon emissions. By limiting car usage, cities such as Bogota and Paris, faced amazing results. Overall by limiting car usage the environment benefits exponentially. In the end the solution to the people choking in the world, is simple limiting car usage. The advantages of this limitation can be seen with benefits to socitey. This can be seen with public benefits, cheaper and time saving methods and of course the environmental benefits.\n",

      "Error processing text: Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered carfree or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to Carfree Day. The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicle. The fights against pollution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and bogota, Colombia. And their efforts against pollution is really starting to take ahold and become popular. In Vauban, Germany The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicle. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the experimental new district. The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for 40,000. Just for a parking lot. Resulting factors from this CarFree suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicle. vaughn's residents seem to rather enjoy the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laugter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor. Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called smart planning. When finished in 2006 57 percent of it's residents sold their vehicle to move into the residence. Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangualr square mile, it is considered to be on of the most advanced experiments in lowcarcarless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Near by these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on a interstatehighway. Even though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New Yorkian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the deam towns of the 1950's. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vaubanlike. In Paris, France Paris enforced a partial driving ban on it's residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris officials ordered motorists with evennumbered license plates to keep their cars at home or they will be fined 22 euros or 31 in American currency. The same ensued for those with oddnumbered plates the next day. Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60 in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blammed diesel vehicle for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesal gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesal made up 67 of all vehicle in France. Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesal vehicle the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consiquences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plugin cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passangers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for oddnumbered plates a few days later. In bogota Colombia Colombian officials set to spread a program across to ohther countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work durring carfree day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to carfree day, all violators would be fined 25. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative tranportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels umungst the city. Despite the heavy rains and grey skies, the turnout was more than expeced. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to bogota to see the carfree event and were exstatic. Claming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders. This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990's. bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The most any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Even new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this carfree day. Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less as time passes by. With the United States being one of the worlds largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindleing with efforts to keep down pollution and smog levels. The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cashstapped Americans couldnt afford to buy new vehicle and that seems to be a persistant happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase. Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to rebrand themselves as mobility companies and reorganising their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 1639 getting a license. Most people are turning to carpooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind. Many countries are getting on the bandwaggon of fighting against pollution, ensueing laws against driving all together, creating temporaty or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, pollution levels. These peoplecountries are taking the innitiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature. There are changes happening, and these changes are benefiting everyone.\n",

      "Error processing text: Many people in the world today think that cars and driving everywhere is a necessity however, many people feel that owning a car is impractical and undesirable. paragraph 43 There are many advantages to having cars, but there are also many more advantages to not using cars wherever people go. Some advantages include conserving resources, making people have a little more money in their pocket and it also improves safety in many suburban cities. In the world today, a major problem that still exists is greenhouse gases. Cars emit a lot of gas that isn't good for the environment. In the first source, it says that people living in cities is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent...in Europe...and up to 50 percent... in the United States.paragraph 5 Exports mean to say that it is better for people to live in cities so they don't have to drive everywhere. This means that the more people that live in cities, the less gas goes into the air. In Paris, the city issued a ban for driving to try and reduce the smog. The second source says that congestion was down to 60 percent in the capital of France, after fivedays of intensifying smog. paragraph 14 Only after five days of the no driving ban, more than half of the smog was gone in Paris. It also says that the amount of smog was almost as polluted at the city of Beijing, China, which is the most polluted city in the world. Bogota also did the same thing. They have an event called A Day Without Cars. Participant Carlos Arturo Plaza says it is a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution.paragraph 24 They also got other cities, and even other countries, to follow suit and join the event. America faces the same problem as Paris too many greenhouse gases are being put into the atmosphere. President Obama has a goal that he wants to achieve and that is to try and make the environment healthy. The last article says that driving less will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.paragraph 34 This implies that the amount of gases let into the air will be reduced. If peolpe didn't drive as much from place to place, the world would be a happier, healthier place. Apart from the fact that cars give of gas, not driving everwhere also means people save more money. In Vauban, Germany, nobody has any cars, they walk or bike to wherever they need to go. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the egde of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home.paragraph 2 People would be more inclined to not getting a car rather than spend an extra 40 grand on top of getting a house for a parking space. Also, in Paris, a fine was issued for people who drove their cars during the car ban. The second article says evennumber license plastes were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine..paragraph 11 If people didn't drive their cars around when they weren't supposed to, they would still have the 22 euros they lost. The same type of fine was issued in Bogota, Columbia. If people drove their cars on A Day Without Cars, then they would have to face a 25 fine. However, in the United States, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.paragraph 29 Without having to pay for a car or gas money, Americans are saving way more money they had been when they first got a car. Wit people not having to worry about payments or gas prices, they have more money in their wallet. Not only does not driving save money and reduce gas, it also improves cities and people's lives. Heidrun Walter, a German media trainer, says that when she had a car, she was always tense. She's much happier this way. paragraph 3 She likes not having to drive everywhere, it makes her feel more calm and less tense. It's not only changing peoples lives, but it's changing the cities. Cities are attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with eless space for parking.paragraph 6 Cities are changing their apperance in order to intice people into driving less and walking or biking more. They intend to make the stores closer together rather than having to drive across the highway to get to the next store. Also in Bogota, there has been a cunstruction of 118 miles of bicycle paths and parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city.paragraphs 2728 With more people walking, the city wants to make the outside apperance different and more appealing than what it looked like before people just used cars. Not driving is not only good for personal well being, but for the a city's well being. There are many advantages to driving cars, such as saving time and getting to places faster but, not driving cars is way better in the long run because of a better environment, saving money and better cities and personal health.\n",

      "Error processing text: The electoral college is an institution that has always guided the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced delegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definite winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us. The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California. Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the winnertakeall system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the candidates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swinglike tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning. A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore. The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.\n",

      "Growth is an essential part of life, and one of the best ways to achieve it is by trying something new. Whether it's learning a new skill, traveling to a new place, or exploring a new hobby, stepping outside of your comfort zone can be both exhilarating and challenging. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of trying something new and provide tips to help readers succeed in it. One of the biggest advantages of trying something new is that it allows you to expand your horizons and gain new experiences. Whether it's learning a new language or taking up a new sport, stepping out of your comfort zone can help you discover new passions and interests that you may not have known existed. Additionally, trying something new can help you build confidence and selfesteem. When you successfully complete a new task or activity, you feel a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can help you feel more confident in other areas of your life. However, trying something new can also have its drawbacks. For one, it can be intimidating and overwhelming, especially if you're not sure where to start or if you're afraid of failure. Additionally, trying something new can be timeconsuming and require a lot of effort, which can be difficult to balance with other responsibilities. Finally, not everyone may enjoy the same activities or hobbies, so trying something new may not always be enjoyable or fulfilling. Despite these challenges, there are several tips that can help you succeed when trying something new. First and foremost, it's important to set realistic goals and expectations. Don't expect to become an expert overnight, and don't be afraid to ask for help or support when you need it. Additionally, it's important to stay positive and openminded. Even if you don't enjoy the activity at first, try to focus on the process and the progress you're making. Finally, don't be afraid to take risks and step out of your comfort zone. While it can be scary to try something new, the rewards can be well worth it. In conclusion, trying something new can be a great way to grow and expand your horizons. While it can be intimidating and challenging, the benefits of stepping out of your comfort zone can be significant. By setting realistic goals, staying positive, and being openminded, you\n",

      "When people are not accepted for who they truly are, it has a devastating impact on interpersonal relationships and professional success. Even though we may be able to connect with others superficially, without the ability to be our true selves, we cannot form meaningful relationships or grow in our career. My own experience shows that when I have hidden my true identity, my relationships have been superficial and I have been unable to reach my full potential in the workplace. Similarly, Ralph Waldo Emerson's famous quote To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment acknowledges the struggle many of us face when we are unable to be accepted for who we truly are. It is clear that authentic acceptance of our true selves is fundamental to healthy relationships and professional success.\n",

But, I mean, there's more to it than just that. Research shows that assigning electives can actually boost motivation, attendance, and grades. Like, whoa! First of all, let's talk about motivation. When we get to choose our own electives, it's like, super easy to lose interest. I mean, if I had to take, like, another math class, I'd totally zone out. But, if I get to choose from cool stuff like photography or drama, I'm way more likely to be motivated. It's like, I'm actually excited to learn something new! And attendance, man. It's a real thing. When we're interested in what we're learning, we're way more likely to show up to class. Like, I know I'm more likely to skip math, but if I get to take a fun elective, I'll be there every day! And grades? Oh, man. Electives can seriously boost those too. When we're engaged in what we're learning, we do better in class. It's like, common sense, right? But, like, research shows that students who take electives tend to have higher GPAs than those who don't. But, like, there are some potential drawbacks to letting students choose their own classes. Some people might take classes that aren't challenging enough, or that don't really interest them. And, like, some teachers might not be as good at teaching certain subjects as others.

      "The debate between nature versus nurture in determining our character traits is one that has long been discussed, and it is difficult to come to a right or wrong conclusion. It is generally accepted that both biological and environmental influences play a role in the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. Biological influences, such as our genetic makeup, play an important role in how we have been hardwired. On the other hand, environmental influences, such as our upbringing, the people around us, and our experiences, often shape the way we think and behave. Ultimately, it is likely that a combination of both nature and nurture are what contributes to our character. While we are born with certain traits based on our genetics, these traits can be shaped and molded by the people and experiences in our lives. Our Outlook on life and the actions we choose to take are shaped by forces outside our control, including our environment and the people around us. Similarly, our sense of self and how we interact with the world is greatly impacted by the standards and expectations of the society we are raised in. Though definitive answers remain elusive, it is important to recognize that both our genetic makeup and our environment contribute to our character. Our individual traits have been deeply affected by the experiences and behaviours we have been exposed to, while also relying on the biological foundations we have been given. Understanding the complexities of this relationship can help us to better understand ourselves, and how our character is formed.\n",

      "Summer is the best time of the year for most of the students it is the season that brings them joy and memories. But, without an organized summer plan, the students are very likely to forget what they have learned in the school year. Because of that, some education systems suggest summer projects for students to practice lessons during their break. However, these assignments that are designed by teachers seem to be unreasonable overload and can ruin the summer vacation that the students have been waiting for. Therefore, students and teachers will both be beneficial in learning and teaching if the lessons are welldesigned. Although some may say that teacherdesigned projects will consist of more important lessons, those that are designed by the students will surely be effective due to its interesting topics and reasonable schedule. Students will be more motivated if the topics come from their fields of interest. With these lessons, there will be less delay for students to work. They will explore new lessons that will later be helpful in their future careers they would be no longer summer projects but are life lessons. For instance, in Generic_School, yearly, there are Capstone topics for students to research a topic of their own interest. There are still requirements that the topics need to meet in order to assure that students will learn new facts from their research but, the lessons' topics are designed by the students. Because of the new learning structure, more students were involved in the projects which resulted in interesting ideas. These projects let the students to express themselves through learning. Another example, summer field trips nowadays are mostly created by students, and they are being applied to new lessons more due to their effectiveness in teaching. Letting the students to design the experiences of the lessons means letting they create their own memories of the lessons which will last longer than that of traditional methods. Being able to explore their fields of interest motivates the students, rather than compels them to learn. Beside having a break and doing school's projects, students should have time for other activities. These activities are the main part of the summer vacation. But, it would be impossible for them to distress and try these new activities if there isn't any time. Junior rising students seem to not have access to summer break due to the overload works in preparing for the SAT and some of the school summer projects. Therefore, if the summer goes on with unreasonable loads of lessons and practices that are needed to be done, there would be lack of access for them to other activities. Summer is also the time for students to explore interesting future careers through internship and jobs opportunities. Consequently, looking at the bigger picture, if a student busy with the summer works from school, he or she will be lost in choosing interesting fields in the future due to their lack of experiences. That says, it is important for students to have time to access new activities that will determine their future. However, there are people who believe that summer projects that are made by students will not cover enough important information, thus teacherdesigned projects are the perfect choice. It is true that important lessons must be covered, but that only should be done during the school year, not during the summer break. Doing so in the summer will distress students even more due to their lack of free time. If the pressure on students keep gaining, mental diseases like depression and mood changes will appear. There are many students in Generic_School and high schools around the world have gotten mental disorders which origin is from school works. Therefore, the main component of the teaching system should be the effectiveness of the lessons, not the amount lessons that are being taught. This is a major cons of the current education system and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. And the only ones who can truly understand the problem are the students. Thus the student's opinions towards the structure of the school's system are very important. Projects and lessons should be designed by the students to guarantee the quality of the lessons. Through interesting topics,students will be more motivated to learn and explore new lessons. They will also have time for new activities, which will eventually help them in life. And more importantly, students will be able to avoid mental diseases, depression, etc therefore, it creates a healthy generation of young adults. Overall, summer projects that are provided by schools should be created from the opinion and interest of students.\n",

      "Introduction As a 12yearold boy, I have always dreamed about traveling the world and experiencing different cultures. The Seagoing Cowboys program, as described in the article, A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves, is the perfect opportunity for me to make my dream a reality. In this essay, I will share with you the reasons why I am excited to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program and how it can benefit you too. Body Firstly, the Seagoing Cowboys program provides a unique opportunity for individuals to participate in humanitarian work. As Luke mentioned in the article, he helped transport livestock to wartorn regions of Europe to help rebuild their economy. By participating, you can be a part of something greater than yourself and make a positive impact on others' lives. Secondly, the Seagoing Cowboys program allows participants to travel to exotic locations and experience different cultures, as demonstrated by Luke's adventures in places such as Greece, Italy, and France. As a young person, I am excited to learn about different parts of the world and immerse myself in new environments. Lastly, Luke's experience with the Seagoing Cowboys program allowed him to develop new skills and gain a sense of independence. He learned how to navigate ships, work with animals, and adapt to new environments. As a student, I am always looking for opportunities to grow and challenge myself, and the Seagoing Cowboys program seems like the perfect fit. Conclusion As demonstrated by Luke's adventures with the Seagoing Cowboys program, participating in the program can provide a unique opportunity to travel, help others, and develop new skills.

      "Do you think it was made by an alien or is it a natural landform? Many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but others say that is a natural thing. In my opinion I think that it's a natural landform. I have 3 examples, first when the camera captured the picture it wasen't clear enough because there were wispy clouds. Second in the artical it said it spotted shadowy likeness of a human face. Third the artical aslo said formed by shadows giving the illusison of eyes, nose, and mouth. First the camera captured the picture, but it wasen't clear enough because when they captured the picture there were wispy cloud which can make it hard to take a picture or to see the picture. This example shows that they might of seen something else such as the face ,but it could be wrong because they captured the picture when there was wispy clouds. Second in the artical it said it spotted shadowy likeness of a human face which can mean that when the picture was captured the camera could have of captured some shadows to which can create an illusion of a face when in reality it could be the showdows. This example shows that the camera captured the shadows which can create and illusion of a face. Third in the artical it also said that formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This can mean that people see it in many way's. the picture creates an illusion that can make you think that it's a face with eyes, nose, and mouth. This example shows that the picture wasn't taken right which can cause an illusion, many people see a face, but that's because the picture creates an illusion of a face. In conclusion many people have different opinions some say aliens created it, but say is a natural landform. Some people may have counter calims first counter claim is why would NASA lie to us. Second counter claim is that the picture showed a face so it is a face. Third counter claim is that they had a good camera so if it shows it then it is a face. My rebuttals would be that NASA is not lieing about the pictures. Second the picture might create an illusion that makes you think it's a face. Third not all cameras show exactly what you want to take a picture of these are my counter claims and rebuttals and also my example and explanantions.\n",

      "The future is coming at an alarming rate. Driverless cars are not just ideas anymore. They are being manufactured and tested at this very moment. Driverless cars can be seen as both good and bad, but I do not think they are good for society just yet. For cars to be driverless, they would have to be able to respond quickly to anything, at anytime. They would also need to possess a faster reaction time than humans. If all of these features were put into a car, then it is no longer a car it is a robotic machine, capable of making decisions that could mean life or death of the passengers and nearby pedestrians. However, as of now, cars are still not entirely driverless. We do not yet have the technology to manufacture cars that have the human qualities that are necessary in driving, such as natural reflexes to avoid obstacles blocking the path. The world we live in today is not the same world we lived in yesterday, or the world we will live in tomorrow. The technology we currenetly have is progressing at an alarming speed. Today it's smart cars, tomorrow it's smart houses, and the next day it's smart people. Technology is a good thing, but humans are so fixated on making everything bigger and better that they forget how good it is now. What will come of the human population if we solely rely on techonolgy and not each other? If driverless cars become the sole transportation for short distances over land, then humans will not find a need to work on their hand eye coordination and reflexes. If that were to happen, then people will start to lose those motor functions. With the speedy progression of technology, humans are slowly beginning to devolve. With the production of smart phones and other tablets, humans have shorter attention spans than their ancestors. I, personally, am against driverless cars because they will help further society into a pit of technology that no one will be able to escape. With these smarter cars, we are leaving our lives in the hands of technology, and it won't stop there. The future is coming with all new toys and gadgets to make our lives simpler and easier, but who wants the boring life of everything being handed to them?\n",

      "I'm against schools that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. Firstly, it's an invasion of privacy. Students should have the right to keep their grades and attendance private, especially if they're doing well. It's like having a permanent report card that anyone can access. That's not cool. Secondly, it puts too much pressure on students. If parents are constantly checking in on their kid's grades, it can make them feel like they're being watched all the time. It's like having a digital babysitter. That can cause a lot of stress for students who are already trying to balance school and other stuff like sports, work, or just hanging out with friends. Thirdly, it's not fair to students who don't have access to the internet or whose parents don't know how to use technology. Some families don't have a computer at home, or their parents might not be techsavvy. It's not fair to penalize those students just because their parents can't get online. Lastly, it's a waste of resources. Schools should focus on teaching us stuff, not on creating fancy websites for parents to monitor us. I mean, come on, my math teacher barely knows how to use a computer. Do we really want to pay him to sit around all day updating grades online? No thanks. In conclusion, schools shouldn't let parents monitor their kids' grades and attendance online. It's an invasion of privacy, it puts too much pressure on us, it's not fair to everyone, and it's a waste of time and money.
