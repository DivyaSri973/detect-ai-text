0e55cb04,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as promote healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. This essay will explore these advantages in more detail.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage set, passenger cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. For example, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and air quality improved.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, after power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health. In the example of Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents report being happier and less tense without the need to rely on cars for transportation. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to overall well-being and improved quality of life.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activity, such as walking or cycling. In the passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day. This event aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By encouraging active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, individuals can improve their physical fitness and reduce the risk of health problems associated with sedentary lifestyles.

In addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable communities. The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" describes how the community of Vauban in Germany is an example of ""smart planning"" to separate suburban life from car use. This concept is being adopted globally to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. By placing stores within walking distance and promoting public transportation, communities can reduce the need for cars, decrease traffic congestion, and create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in various contexts. To achieve these advantages, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, and to plan communities that support these options.",radek_500,1,0.0,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment.

a26ef41b57ab_04112023,"The photograph of the ""Face on Mars"" has sparked intense debate about whether this landform was created naturally or by an ancient civilization. As a scientist at NASA who studied this image closely, I do not believe there is sufficient evidence to support the idea that aliens carved this formation. Instead, I will argue that the ""Face on Mars"" is simply a coincidental arrangement of natural landforms on the Martian surface. 

One of my main claims is that the individual geometric shapes that make up the ""Face"" can each be explained as natural geological features common on Mars. For example, the two dark spots above the mouth that look like eyes are just impact craters, rounded depressions formed when meteorites collided with the planet's surface. Impact craters of varying sizes are abundant throughout Mars' history. Similarly, the triangular shape below that some see as a nose could easily be a mesa, a type of isolated hill created by erosion. Mesas with steep cliffs on one side and a gentle slope on others are widespread in Mars' terrain. 

I also have photographic evidence from NASA's Viking orbiter mission in the 1970s to support my argument. Upon closer examination of the original high-resolution image, the shapes that appear to form distinct features of a face become less clear and more ambiguous. The edges are indistinct and blurry, which is not what we would expect for artificial structures. But it is consistent with the known resolution limitations of the Viking cameras at that altitude. Additionally, images of the surrounding area do not reveal any other signs of an ancient civilization such as roads, buildings or other sculptures. If aliens sculpted one massive likeness, it seems unlikely they would stop there. 

In conclusion, while patterns in nature can sometimes look designed, the preponderance of evidence points to the ""Face on Mars"" being a random formation rather than the work of extraterrestrials. Although intriguing to imagine what life might exist beyond our planet, as scientists we must follow evidence, not speculation, in evaluating extraordinary claims. For these reasons, I remain convinced the ""Face on Mars"" was created by natural geological processes over millions of years, not by an alien civilization.",darragh_claude_v6,1,0.0,"The photograph of the Face on Mars has sparked intense debate about whether this landform was created naturally or by an ancient civilization.

F4FC2D64C127,"Title: The Importance of Inactive Times in Our Lives

Hey there! As an 8th grader, I'm here to tell you about the dangers of not having regular inactive times and how they can negatively impact our lives. In this essay, I'll share some real-life examples, personal experiences, and the benefits of having regular inactive times.

Firstly, let's talk about the dangers of not having inactive times. When we don't take breaks and rest our minds and bodies, we can experience burnout, stress, and decreased productivity. For instance, if we're constantly glued to our screens, whether it's our phones, tablets, or laptops, we can become less creative, less focused, and more prone to mental health issues. A real-life example of this is when I was constantly studying for exams without taking any breaks, and I started feeling anxious and stressed. I realized that I needed to take breaks and give my brain a rest to perform better.

Now, let's talk about the benefits of having regular inactive times. Research has shown that taking breaks can increase our lifespan, boost our creativity, and give us more energy. When we take breaks, our brains get a chance to relax and recharge, which can help us come up with new ideas and solutions. For example, some of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, are known to take long walks and meditate to clear their minds and come up with innovative ideas.

Personally, I've found that taking short breaks during my school day has helped me stay focused and energized. When I take a few minutes to stretch, breathe deeply, or read a book, I feel more refreshed and ready to tackle my work. In fact, I've noticed that I'm more productive and creative when I take breaks, and I'm able to complete my work faster and with better quality.

In addition, regular inactive times can help individuals achieve their goals. When we take breaks, we give ourselves time to reflect on our progress, set new goals, and reassess our priorities.

Additionally, many employers require a high school diploma or higher education degree for certain positions, making it difficult for individuals without a degree to find employment.

Secondly, graduating from school is necessary to achieve many of our goals. For example, many careers require a certain level of education, and without a high school diploma or higher education degree, it can be challenging to secure a job in that field. Additionally, many individuals dream of pursuing higher education, which typically requires a high school diploma as a prerequisite.

Thirdly, passing classes can be challenging, but it is a necessary part of graduating from school. The difficulty of passing classes varies depending on the subject and the student's abilities, but it requires hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn.

Fourthly, there are many things that cannot be achieved without a high school diploma or higher education degree. For example, many individuals cannot obtain a driver's license without a high school diploma. Additionally, many jobs require a certain level of education, and without a degree, it can be difficult to find employment.

Lastly, graduating from school is a significant accomplishment that many students look forward to.

Research shows that when students are exposed to these subjects, they become more innovative and better at thinking outside the box. This is like, totally crucial in today's world, where we need people who can come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. Plus, these skills can help students in other subjects too, like math and science, because they learn how to approach problems from different angles and think critically. 💡

When students learn to express themselves through art, music, and drama, they become better at understanding and managing their emotions. This can help them in their personal lives, but also in their future careers, where they'll need to be able to work well with others and communicate effectively. 💔

Now, let's talk about how the arts can help represent a country's culture. Music, for example, is like, totally a huge part of any culture.

D5202DF530D1,"Making decisions is a crucial aspect of life, and it is important to understand the pros and cons of making decisions independently or seeking guidance from experts and authorities. In this essay, I will analyze the potential impact that seeking guidance can have on an individual's future decision-making skills, examine a real-life example of a decision made independently or with external guidance, and consider the consequences of continual reliance on outside help for making decisions.

One of the main advantages of making decisions independently is that it allows individuals to take full control of their lives. When people make decisions on their own, they are able to choose what they want to do and how they want to do it. This can lead to greater personal satisfaction and a sense of agency. Additionally, making decisions independently can help individuals develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to making decisions independently. For example, people may not have all the necessary information or resources to make informed decisions. Additionally, people may be biased or make decisions based on emotions rather than logic. These factors can lead to poor decision-making and negative consequences.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be beneficial in certain situations. For example, when making a major decision such as choosing a college or career path, seeking guidance from experts can provide valuable insights and help individuals make informed decisions. Additionally, seeking guidance can help individuals develop important skills such as communication and collaboration.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to seeking guidance. For example, people may be influenced by the opinions of others and not make decisions based on their own values and beliefs. Additionally, seeking guidance can be time-consuming and may require individuals to give up control of certain aspects of their lives.

A real-life example of a decision made independently is the decision to start a business. Many successful entrepreneurs have made this decision without seeking guidance from experts or authorities. These individuals have taken control of their lives and have been able to achieve their goals.

A real-life example of a decision made with external guidance is the decision to go to college.

71F27422C5FC,"Dear Local Government,

I am writing to express my strong objections to the proposal of changing the school system from a five-day to a four-day workweek. It is my belief that this will prove to be damaging in a multitude of ways. 

Firstly, the lack of an extra day will drastically cut down the amount of time in the day for students to do their work, test their skills during extracurricular activities, and participate in other academic engagements, making it nearly impossible for them to establish a balance between leisurely activities and extracurricular activities. Furthermore, the truncated amount of time available for learning and growth will reduce the quality of education that the students witness in their respective disciplines.

A four-day school week will also cause undue stress and pressure on students, as all their lessons will be crammed into four days rather than five, making it hard for them to take a break from the workload. Additionally, with the three-day weekend, students may become lethargic and unenthusiastic in learning and developing skills, and gradually become less productive. 

This year’s final exams have shown us how the five-day school week motivates students to become more prepared for the assessments and can help them be ready for the future. Without this extra day, it is likely that student achievement will go down. 

For all these reasons, I urge you not to adopt a four-day work week and to maintain the five-day school week for better academic achievements and continuity.

7600F1C7D884,"Homeschooling vs. Traditional Schooling: Which is Right for You?

As an eighth-grader, I have heard a lot of debate about whether homeschooling or traditional schooling is the best option for education. While there are pros and cons to both, ultimately, the decision depends on the individual and their family's needs and preferences.

One of the main advantages of homeschooling is the ability to tailor the curriculum to the student's learning style. Homeschooled students can learn at their own pace and focus on subjects that they find particularly challenging or interesting. Additionally, homeschooling provides a more personalized and individualized education experience. Teachers can provide one-on-one attention and support, which can be difficult to achieve in a traditional classroom setting.

On the other hand, attending a traditional school provides the opportunity to socialize with peers and participate in extracurricular activities. These experiences can help students develop important social and teamwork skills that are essential for success in the workplace and beyond. Additionally, traditional schools often offer a wider range of courses and programs than homeschools, which can provide students with more opportunities to explore their interests and talents.

Despite these advantages, homeschooling can be challenging for both the student and the parent. Homeschooling requires a significant amount of time and effort from the parent, who must serve as both teacher and administrator. Additionally, homeschooled students may miss out on the socialization opportunities and extracurricular activities that are available in traditional schools.

Attending a traditional school can also present its own challenges. Students may struggle to keep up with the pace of their peers or feel overwhelmed by the large class sizes. Additionally, traditional schools can be rigid and inflexible, which can make it difficult for students to pursue their individual interests and learning styles.

To be successful in a traditional school setting, parents can help their children in several ways. First, they can encourage their children to participate in extracurricular activities and join clubs or sports teams. This can help students develop important social and teamwork skills, as well as provide opportunities for personal growth and development.

Additionally, parents can help their children stay organized and on track with their assignments.

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent of [State], I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. While there are valid arguments for both sides, I believe that the Electoral College system is essential for maintaining fair and balanced elections in our great nation, ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard and protecting the interests of smaller states.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation. This system ensures that each state has a fair representation in the presidential election, preventing larger states from overpowering smaller ones.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. By having electors vote for the President, rather than a direct popular vote, we avoid the risk of disputed outcomes. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, allowing for a more decisive result. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to recounts and potential disputes, as seen in the 2000 election. The Electoral College minimizes the chance of such scenarios and provides a clear winner.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's president. Candidates need to have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on support from one region. This prevents presidents from neglecting the interests and concerns of certain regions, as they would be representing all states and not just the ones they won in the popular vote. By requiring candidates to seek votes from across the country, the Electoral College promotes better representation and a broader understanding of the diverse needs of our communities.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is its encouragement of campaign focus in swing states. Candidates dedicate their resources and efforts to states where the election outcome is uncertain. This ensures that the needs and concerns of these diverse states are addressed, as swing states are more likely to receive attention from candidates. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus solely on highly populated areas and ignore the smaller states, effectively silencing the voices of millions of Americans in less populated regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate already grants smaller states equal representation, and the Electoral College complements this by giving each state a minimum of three electors. This ensures that larger states do not completely dominate the election process, preserving the interests and influence of smaller states. It acts as a check to prevent the tyranny of the majority, ensuring that all states have a say in the election of our President.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. It provides a clear winner, preventing complicated and potentially lengthy run-off elections that could further extend the already long presidential election process. By streamlining the election process, the Electoral College allows for a more efficient selection of our President.

In conclusion, Senator, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system. It guarantees fair representation for all states, encourages trans-regional appeal in candidates, protects the interests of smaller states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While there are rightful criticisms surrounding this system, it is important to consider the practical advantages it offers. I urge you to keep the Electoral College intact and protect the interests of our great nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my viewpoint and make decisions that benefit the welfare of our state and country as a whole. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this issue in more detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.

DCE82F61BE10,"Hey, so for this essay, I had to research the pros and cons of taking online courses versus going to traditional school. At first, I thought it would be really easy to just pick one and be like, ""Yeah, this is totally better,"" but it turns out it's actually pretty complicated.

So, let's start with the pros of online courses. One of the biggest pros is that you can take them from anywhere, like at home or on vacation. That means you can learn at your own pace and not have to worry about missing school just because you're on a trip. Plus, some people might find it easier to learn online because they can rewind the video or look at stuff again if they didn't understand it the first time around. And, you know, you can wear your pajamas if you want to. (laughs)

But, there are also some cons to online courses. One of them is that you might not get as much social interaction as you would in a traditional classroom. That can be kind of lonely, especially if you're a super social person. And, some people might find it harder to focus when they're not in a real classroom with other kids. Plus, you don't get to see your teacher's funny faces or anything. (laughs)

Now, let's talk about traditional classes. One of the pros of going to school is that you get to see your friends and teachers every day. That's nice, especially if you're a really social person. And, you get to ask questions and get help in real time, which can be really helpful. Plus, you can see your teacher's funny faces and stuff. (laughs)

But, there are also some cons to traditional classes. One of them is that it can be really expensive to go to school. Like, you have to buy books and stuff, and sometimes you have to pay for transportation. And, if you miss school, you might fall behind on your work. Plus, you have to go to school at a specific time every day, which can be tough if you have other stuff to do.

CE7FCD160837," It is commonly argued that students should commit to a career before entering high school. While it is true that choosing a career at a young age can provide an early start on researching and pursuing that career, I believe that committing to a career at such a young age is not a good idea.

Firstly, it is important to note that even college students often change their major or career path. This means that there is a high likelihood that a student who commits to a career at a young age will eventually change their mind and pursue a different career. Therefore, it is important for students to have more time to explore their interests and make an informed decision about their career path.

Secondly, students are only 14-15 years old when they are making these decisions. At this age, they may not have fully explored their interests and hobbies, and may not have the necessary knowledge and experience to make a confident decision about their career.

EB3D751AD980,"Hey there! So, for this essay, I had to learn about the different subjects taught in elementary school and how teachers make lessons interesting and engaging for students. I talked to some of my teachers and did some research to find out some cool stuff.

First of all, there are a lot of subjects in elementary school! Like, a lot. You've got math, science, language arts, social studies, and sometimes even art and music. And each one of those subjects has its own special ways of teaching and learning.

My math teacher, Mrs. Johnson, uses a lot of hands-on activities and games to help us understand numbers and patterns. She'll give us puzzles to solve or have us play math-based games like ""Math Bingo"" or ""Math War"". It's really fun and it makes me want to learn more. My science teacher, Mr. Smith, does cool experiments like making slime or growing crystals. He'll also show us videos of cool things like volcanoes or the solar system. It's like a whole different world!

My language arts teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez, reads us stories and has us do fun activities like writing our own stories or making a ""Wall of Words"" with words that start with the same sound. She also makes us do a lot of group work, which is cool because I get to work with my friends. My social studies teacher, Mr. Lee, teaches us about different cultures and countries. He'll show us pictures and videos of different places and people, and we'll even get to make our own maps!

I also talked to some of my family members and friends about their elementary school experiences. My little sister said her teacher used to let them have dance parties during P.E. class, which is pretty cool. My friend Jack said his teacher would let them play board games during lunchtime, which I think is a pretty fun way to learn.

To really see how students learn, I went to my school's library and observed some kids during their reading time. They were all so focused and engaged, reading their own books or listening to the librarian read aloud. It was really inspiring to see how much they loved learning.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and whether it should be kept or changed to a popular vote system for electing the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of the information from multiple sources, including the texts provided, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. It ensures that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote surpasses their share of the popular vote, making it less likely for disputes over the election’s outcome to occur. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winner-take-all basis of most states' allocation of electoral votes leads to landslide victories for the winning candidate, thereby reducing the likelihood of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters the idea of a president being everyone's president. This system requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal since no single region has enough electoral votes to determine the outcome. As mentioned by Judge Posner, a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president as it may leave residents of other regions feeling disregarded and disenfranchised. By necessitating candidates to broaden their appeal beyond a single region, the Electoral College ensures that the elected president represents the entire nation's interests.

Moreover, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, encouraging candidates to pay close attention to the concerns and issues faced by voters in these states. As stated in Judge Posner's text, swing states receive extensive campaign efforts and information from candidates due to their potential to decide the election. This engagement fosters thoughtful voting, as voters in these states have a greater incentive to closely evaluate and consider the candidates' policies and plans for the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political balance that large states might otherwise lose due to the Senate's malapportionment. According to Judge Posner, the Electoral College gives large states more attention from presidential candidates, as victories in these states yield a higher number of electoral votes. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the concerns of smaller states, which could lead to the neglect of the interests of larger, more populous states.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections by ensuring that a majority winner is always determined. As mentioned by Judge Posner, the Electoral College eliminates the pressure for run-off elections when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast. This simplifies the presidential election process, avoiding further complications and costs associated with additional voting rounds.

While some argue that a change to a popular vote system would make the electoral process fairer, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks. Moving to a popular vote system would concentrate campaign efforts solely on densely populated urban areas and neglect the interests of smaller states and rural communities. Additionally, it could potentially lead to run-off elections and endless recounts when no candidate secures a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept due to the certainty of outcome, the principle of everyone's president, the focus on swing states, the balance it brings to large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. While improvements can always be made to the system, the Electoral College effectively serves its purpose of representing the diverse interests of the American people. I urge you to consider the valuable aspects of the Electoral College when evaluating potential changes to our electoral process.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to seeing our system flourish while maintaining its integrity.

Making decisions in life can be super hard sometimes. Like, really hard. Like, why can't I just have a magic 8 ball that tells me what to do?! But, sadly, there isn't one of those. BUT, there are other ways to make decisions that are way better than just flipping a coin or something. Like, you can ask your family, experts, and authorities for advice!

And the best part is, they're always gonna be there for you, no matter what. They're like, your homebase or something.

Experts are also really good to ask for advice. Like, if you're trying to decide what to do after high school, you can ask a guidance counselor or something. They know way more about colleges and careers than you do, so they can give you really good advice. And if you're trying to decide what to eat for dinner, you can ask your mom or dad, or even a food blogger on Instagram! They can give you ideas and recipes and stuff.

First impressions are super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and they're all like, ""Hi, I'm Sarah!"" and you're like, ""Hey, nice to meet you!"" And then you start talking and you're like, ""Wow, this person is really cool!"" But then, like, a few minutes later, they do something that's like, totally not cool, and you're like, ""Uh, I don't know if I like you anymore.""

But, like, sometimes first impressions can be wrong, you know? Like, I met this guy once and he was all like, ""Hey, man, I'm super chill and funny!"" And I was like, ""Yeah, okay, cool!"" But then we started talking and he was like, totally different. He was actually really nice and funny, but I was like, ""Uh, I don't know if I want to hang out with you anymore.""

And it's not just people, either. Like, have you ever seen those animal documentaries where they show how animals can be like, totally different from what you think they are? Like, this one time I saw a video of a snake that was all like, ""Hey, I'm not gonna bite you, dude!"" And I was like, ""Whoa, that's so cool!"" But then it turned out that it was just pretending to be nice so it could, like, sneak up on its prey or something.

So, like, first impressions aren't always right, you know? It's important to give people and animals a chance to show you who they really are, instead of just judging them based on how they look or act at first. Because, like, you never know, they might surprise you!

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus is a worthy scientific pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the article, several key points of evidence are presented to support this claim. 

One critical piece of evidence is the scientific value that can be gained from Venus exploration. Venus shares many similarities to Earth as a terrestrial planet, yet its surface environment could not be more different due to its extreme heat and atmospheric pressure. By studying Venus, scientists can learn valuable insights about planetary evolution and the runaway greenhouse effect. Understanding if Venus was always as it is now or had a more Earth-like past could lend important perspectives on Earth's own climate history and future. These scientific rewards justify facing the risks of a Venus mission.

Furthermore, the author notes that technological solutions may mitigate many of the hazards. With modern materials and engineering, we can design probes and robots able to withstand Venus's harsh conditions much longer than previous missions. Shielding and insulation technologies have come a long way since the early Soviet landers melted within hours. Additionally, exploring Venus from its relatively temperate upper atmosphere may sidestep some of the problems of intense heat at the surface itself. Technological progress reduces the level of risk, shifting the risk-reward calculation further towards exploration. 

In conclusion, while Venus presents extreme dangers to exploration, the potential scientific value to be gained and ongoing improvements in technology support the article's central argument that studying Venus is worthy of our effort and resources despite the risks. The author provides persuasive evidence that Venus missions can expand our understanding of planetary science in fundamentally important ways.

falcon_180b_v1_66,"I do not have personal opinions, but i can provide a response to the prompt.

the debate about whether video games can contribute to violent behavior has been ongoing for many years. some people argue that violent video games can lead to aggressive behavior, while others believe that there is no correlation between playing video games and real-life violence.

those who support the idea that video games can contribute to violent behavior often cite studies that show a correlation between playing violent video games and increased aggression. for example, a study by anderson and bushman in 2001 found that playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive thoughts and feelings. additionally, they found that playing non-violent video games did not have this effect.

furthermore, supporters of this idea believe that video games desensitize people to violence. they argue that playing violent video games can make people numb to the consequences of violence and make them more likely to engage in violent behavior themselves. for example, a person who plays a game like ""call of duty"" may become more comfortable with the idea of shooting someone and may be more likely to engage in violent behavior in real life.

however, opponents of this idea argue that there is no clear evidence that playing video games leads to violent behavior. they point to the fact that many people who play violent video games never engage in any sort of real-life violence. additionally, they argue that other factors, such as a person's upbringing, environment, and mental health, may be more important in determining whether they will engage in violent behavior.

CA290993DFBA,"As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to take both online and traditional classes. While online classes offer many benefits, such as flexibility and convenience, they also have their fair share of disadvantages. In this essay, I will analyze the disadvantages of taking online classes, compare the consequences of not taking notes to not paying attention in an online class, and examine why online classes are not beneficial for students.

Firstly, online classes can be isolating for students. Without the face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates, it can be challenging to form connections and ask for help when needed. This can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement in the course material. Additionally, online classes require a level of self-discipline and responsibility that can be difficult for some students to maintain. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their assignments and deadlines.

Secondly, not taking notes in an online class can have the same consequences as not paying attention in a traditional class. Without notes, students may struggle to recall important information later on, leading to a lack of understanding and difficulty completing assignments. Furthermore, online classes often require students to actively engage with the course material, such as through discussion forums and quizzes. Without notes, students may struggle to participate in these activities effectively.

Finally, online classes may not be beneficial for students because they may not provide the same level of hands-on experience as traditional classes. Many courses require students to conduct experiments or complete projects that cannot be done online. Without these experiences, students may not develop the same level of practical knowledge and skills that they would in a traditional classroom.

In conclusion, while online classes offer many benefits, they also have their disadvantages. Isolation, lack of motivation, and difficulty in completing assignments are just a few of the drawbacks of taking online classes. Furthermore, not taking notes in an online class can have the same consequences as not paying attention in a traditional class, and online classes may not provide the same level of hands-on experience as traditional classes.

darragh_claude_v7_89,"The Development of Driverless Cars

While driverless cars present many potential benefits, their widespread adoption also carries significant risks that require careful consideration. According to the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", these autonomous vehicles could help reduce accidents caused by human error on the road. However, replacing human drivers with computers to navigate traffic also means relinquishing a degree of control and trust in still-evolving technology. 

One promising aspect cited in favor of driverless cars is their ability to sense their surroundings and communicate with each other in ways that could prevent collisions. By constantly monitoring conditions and coordinating movement, these vehicles might end traffic accidents resulting from human mistakes like distracted driving or failure to brake in time. Proponents argue this could save lives on a large scale over time. The article also notes driverless cars could provide independence to those unable to drive themselves, such as the elderly or disabled. By removing the need for a licensed operator, these populations would gain new mobility options.

At the same time, the article acknowledges significant technical and ethical challenges surrounding widespread driverless car adoption. While computers never get tired, drunk or angry behind the wheel like people, they are still programmed by humans who can make mistakes. Autonomous systems may struggle in unexpected situations outside of routine traffic flows. There is also uncertainty around how driverless cars should respond in emergency scenarios, such as choosing whether to risk crashing or avoid collisions by endangering pedestrians instead of passengers. Without further advances and rigorous testing to resolve such issues, relinquishing too much control to autonomous vehicles risks new kinds of accidents beyond human error. 

In conclusion, while driverless cars could eventually transform transportation for the better if developed responsibly, the risks of a premature rollout mean they require more progress to ensure public safety first. Rather than immediate adoption, the priority should be allowing autonomous vehicles on the roads only alongside further research and regulation to verify they can drive as safely as human drivers in all conditions before replacing them completely. The potential Mobility and independence benefits of driverless cars are promising, but they must put people's well-being above all else as the technology continues to evolve.",darragh_claude_v7,1,0.0,"The Development of Driverless Cars While driverless cars present many potential benefits, their widespread adoption also carries significant risks that require careful consideration.

llama_70b_v1307,"Hi, I'm a 7th grader and I'm writing an essay about privacy protections on social media. I think it's important to talk about this because lots of people are sharing personal information online and it's not always safe.

First, let's talk about why privacy protections are important. When we're online, we share things like our name, age, location, and interests. This information can be accessed by anyone, including people who might want to hurt us. For example, if a stranger knows where we live, they could try to find us and do something bad. Or, if we share too much personal information, hackers could use it to steal our identity or pretend to be us online. This could be really dangerous, especially for kids and teens.

Another reason privacy protections are important is that they can help us control who sees our information. When we post something online, we want to be able to choose who can see it. But sometimes, even if we think we're only sharing something with our friends, it can still be seen by other people. This can be really embarrassing or even dangerous. For example, if we post a picture of ourselves in a swimsuit, someone could see it and think it's okay to share it with other people without our permission. This could happen even if we think we're only sharing it with our close friends.

So, what can we do to protect our privacy on social media? One thing is to use strong privacy settings. Most social media apps have settings that let us control who can see our posts, who can contact us, and even who can see our personal information. It's important to take the time to review these settings and make sure they're set to what we're comfortable with. We should also think carefully before posting anything online. Sometimes, it's better not to share something at all, especially if it's something that could be used against us.

Another way to protect our privacy is to use two-factor authentication. This means that when we log in to our social media account, we have to enter a code that's sent to our phone or email in addition to our password. This makes it much harder for someone to hack into our account, even if they do know our password.

Finally, it's important to be careful about the apps we download and the websites we visit. Some apps and websites might try to steal our personal information, so it's important to only download apps and visit websites that we trust.

In conclusion, privacy protections are really important on social media. By using strong privacy settings, being careful about what we post, using two-factor authentication, and being careful about the apps and websites we use, we can help keep our personal information safe and protect ourselves from potential danger.

llama_70b_v1347,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College vs popular vote for the president of the United States. As a 6th grader, I have been learning about the different ways that the president is elected and the pros and cons of each method.

Firstly, I believe that the Electoral College has its benefits. It ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and that the president is elected by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones. This helps to ensure that the president is accountable to voters in all states, rather than just those in the biggest ones.

However, I also understand the argument for election by popular vote. It seems unfair that a candidate can win the presidency without receiving the most votes nationwide. This can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency without having the support of the majority of voters.

After reading the provided passages, I have come to realize that both methods have their flaws. The Electoral College can lead to a situation where a candidate wins without receiving the most votes, as we saw in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. On the other hand, election by popular vote could lead to a situation where smaller states are ignored and the president is only accountable to voters in the biggest states.

In my opinion, a combination of both methods could be the best solution. We could keep the Electoral College, but have a system in place to ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide also wins the presidency. This would ensure that both smaller and bigger states have a voice in the election.

I understand that changing the method of electing the president is a complex issue and there are many factors to consider. However, I believe that it is important to ensure that the president is elected in a fair and democratic manner. I urge you to consider my opinion and work towards finding a solution that benefits all Americans.

falcon_180b_v1_717,"Dear Principal,

I am writing in regards to the potential policy changes regarding cell phones on campus. I believe that the policy that would allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time would be the best decision for our school. 

First and foremost, allowing students to have their phones with them will help them stay connected to family members and guardians in case of emergency situations. With the increasing number of school shootings and other violent incidents, students and parents should be able to communicate with each other in case of such emergencies. This policy would give us a sense of security and allow us to feel safer while we are at school.

Furthermore, many students use phones for educational purposes. For example, students may use apps to study or to access educational websites. Additionally, teachers may incorporate technology into their lessons, which would require the use of cell phones. Allowing students to have their phones with them would provide more opportunities for learning and academic advancement.

I understand that there may be concerns about distractions caused by cell phones. However, students who want to use their phones during class will find a way to do so, regardless of the policy. Additionally, it would be the responsibility of the teachers to make sure that their students are not using their phones during class time.

In conclusion, I believe that allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times would be the best policy.

Introduction:
Hey there! As an 8th grader, I've learned that having a good imagination and knowledge are super important in achieving our goals. Without them, we might miss out on some amazing opportunities. In this essay, I'll explain why imagination and knowledge are crucial, and how they can help us reach our dreams.

Imagination is like a magic wand that lets us dream big. It allows us to visualize things that don't exist yet, and come up with new ideas that can change the world. Without imagination, we wouldn't have things like technology, art, or even science. It's the spark that ignites creativity and innovation. But, it's not just about dreaming big, it's also about problem-solving. Imagination helps us think outside the box and come up with solutions to complex problems.

Knowledge, on the other hand, is like a map that guides us towards our goals. It's the foundation upon which our dreams are built. Without knowledge, we wouldn't know how to turn our ideas into reality. It's the key to unlocking our potential and achieving success. Knowledge helps us understand the world around us, and how to navigate it. It's what sets us apart from others and makes us stand out.

But, achieving our goals requires more than just imagination and knowledge. It takes effort! Effort is like the gas that powers our imagination and knowledge. Without it, we wouldn't be able to turn our ideas into reality. It's the fuel that keeps us going, even when things get tough. Effort is what separates the dreamers from the doers.

Now, let me give you an example of how imagination and knowledge can come together to help us achieve our goals. Let's say you want to apply for your dream job. You've always been fascinated by space exploration, and you want to work for NASA. You use your imagination to visualize yourself working on a space mission, and you spend countless hours researching and learning everything you can about space travel. You imagine yourself solving complex problems and overcoming obstacles, and you use your knowledge to come up",llama2_chat,1,0.0,"Title The Power of Imagination and Knowledge in Achieving Success Introduction Hey there!

F44AE6192EA9," In his essay, ""Self-Reliance,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson posits that individuals must strive to achieve beyond their current abilities in order to experience growth. I concur with Emerson's perspective, as I believe that pushing oneself to learn and explore new things is crucial to personal development and success.

One of the key reasons why I agree with Emerson is that the experiences we accumulate throughout our lives can make us stronger, both mentally and emotionally. When we push ourselves to try new things and take on challenges, we develop resilience and a greater sense of self-confidence. This, in turn, enables us to tackle even more difficult tasks and achieve our goals.

Furthermore, I believe that it is important to stay focused on our goals and to remain committed to them, even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. By doing so, we can continue to grow and develop, both as individuals and as members of society.

Personally, I have found that pushing myself to learn and explore new things has been a key factor in my own personal growth. Whether it's learning a new language, taking up a new hobby, or pursuing a new career path, I have found that the process of learning and growing has been incredibly rewarding.

EBD586EB3AA8," The idea of extending school days to four days a week has been a topic of debate among educators, parents, and students. While some people believe that this change would benefit students, others argue that it could have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.

On the one hand, proponents of a four-day school week argue that it would provide students with more time to learn and engage in extracurricular activities. By having more time in the classroom, students would be able to focus on their studies and take advantage of additional resources and support. Additionally, a four-day school week could help reduce stress and burnout among students, allowing them to better balance their academic and personal lives.

On the other hand, opponents of a four-day school week argue that it could have negative consequences for students and their families. For example, students who have part-time jobs or are responsible for taking care of younger siblings may not have the time or resources to continue working or caring for others. Additionally, students who are already struggling academically may struggle even more with the added time in the classroom.

In my opinion, the benefits of a four-day school week may outweigh the potential drawbacks. While it is true that some students may struggle with the added time in the classroom, this could be mitigated through additional support and resources provided by schools. Additionally, the potential benefits of reduced stress and burnout among students could have a positive impact on their academic performance and overall well-being.

Ultimately, the decision to implement a four-day school week should be based on a careful consideration of the potential benefits and drawbacks. While it may not be the best solution for all students, it could be a valuable tool for improving the academic and personal lives of many.",mistral7binstruct_v2,1,0.0,"The idea of extending school days to four days a week has been a topic of debate among educators, parents, and students.

The author outlines several compelling reasons for continuing Venus exploration that counterbalance the dangers. First, Venus represents an intriguing target for understanding the evolution of terrestrial planets. As Earth's sister world, Venus offers clues about planetary formation and habitability. Second, Venus's extreme climate could yield new insights applicable to climate science and engineering challenges on Earth. Data from Venus missions may help mitigate the impacts of global warming.

959946A3FB03," The advancement of technology has allowed people to perform various tasks without any human interaction. While technology has its benefits, it also has negative effects on individuals' lives. One of the most significant drawbacks of technology is that it can lead to social isolation and a lack of interpersonal skills.

As technology becomes more prevalent, people are increasingly relying on it for communication and socializing. This reliance can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction, which can have negative consequences on mental health and well-being. For example, individuals who spend too much time on social media may experience anxiety and depression due to the constant need for validation and attention.

Another negative effect of technology is that it can restrict individuals from experiencing the world around them. Technology can be used to avoid real-life experiences, such as travel and exploration, which can lead to a lack of personal growth and development. Additionally, technology can limit individuals' ability to form meaningful relationships with others, as it can be difficult to establish trust and intimacy through online communication.

Despite these negative effects, technology can also have positive impacts on individuals' lives. For example, technology can be used to connect people with others who share similar interests and hobbies, which can lead to new friendships and social connections. Additionally, technology can be used to access information and resources that may not be available in one's immediate surroundings, which can lead to personal growth and development.

In conclusion, while technology has its benefits, it also has negative effects on individuals' lives.

llama_70b_v1516,"Dear Teacher,

I think the legalization of marijuana is a really important topic that people have been talking about a lot lately. Some people think it's a good idea, while others don't. In my essay, I'm going to argue for the legalization of marijuana and give some reasons why.

Firstly, I think it's important to say that marijuana is already being used by a lot of people, even though it's not legal. According to a survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 36 million people in the United States have used marijuana in the past year. That's a lot of people! By making it legal, the government can regulate the production and sale of marijuana, which would make it safer for people to use.

Secondly, legalizing marijuana could help reduce crime. Right now, a lot of criminal organizations make money from selling marijuana illegally. If marijuana were legal, these organizations wouldn't be able to make as much money from it, and that could help reduce crime. Additionally, law enforcement agencies could focus on more serious crimes instead of spending resources on investigating and prosecuting people for possessing small amounts of marijuana.

Thirdly, legalizing marijuana could also help people who are sick. Some people use marijuana for medical reasons, like to relieve pain or nausea. If marijuana were legal, it would be easier for these people to get the medicine they need. Doctors and scientists have found that marijuana can be effective in treating conditions like cancer, HIV/AIDS, and multiple sclerosis.

Finally, I think it's important to say that legalizing marijuana wouldn't necessarily mean that more people would start using it. In fact, studies have shown that the number of people using marijuana doesn't necessarily go up when it's legalized. For example, in Colorado, where marijuana is legal, the number of people using it has actually stayed the same.

In conclusion, I think the legalization of marijuana is a good idea. It would make the drug safer, reduce crime, help sick people, and wouldn't necessarily lead to more people using it. I hope this essay helps show why legalizing marijuana is a good idea.

Sincerely,

EC2758A5B74E,"Dear School Board,

I strongly support the proposal to extend the school day by one and a half hours. I believe that this change would greatly benefit students, teachers, and the school community as a whole.

Firstly, students would benefit from a longer school day in several ways. For one, they would have more time to learn and practice new skills. For example, if students had an extra hour and a half to devote to math, they could spend more time practicing problems and working on their understanding of the subject. This would lead to better academic performance and a stronger foundation in math. Additionally, a longer school day would provide students with more opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs. This would allow them to explore their interests and develop new skills outside of the classroom.

Secondly, teachers would also benefit from a longer school day. Teachers are responsible for not only teaching their students, but also preparing for their lessons and grading assignments. A longer school day would give them more time to plan and prepare for their lessons, as well as grade assignments and assessments. This would reduce their workload and allow them to focus more on their teaching and interacting with their students. Furthermore, a longer school day would provide teachers with more time to collaborate with their colleagues and share best practices. This would lead to better teaching and improved student outcomes.

Lastly, a longer school day would benefit the whole school community. For one, it would lead to a more structured and organized school day. With more time to learn and practice new skills, students would be better prepared for their future careers and lives. Additionally, a longer school day would provide a more consistent and reliable schedule for students, teachers, and parents. This would reduce the stress and confusion that can come with changes to the school schedule.

In conclusion, I strongly support the proposal to extend the school day by one and a half hours. I believe that this change would greatly benefit students, teachers, and the school community as a whole. Students would have more time to learn and practice new skills, teachers would have more time to plan and prepare for their lessons, and the school community would have a more structured and organized school day. I urge you to consider this proposal and make it a reality.

llama_70b_v1723,"Zoos are like super important for conservation and education and stuff. They help us learn about animals and their habitats and how to protect them. But some people think they're cruel and that we shouldn't keep animals in captivity. I think zoos are good because they help us learn about animals and how to take care of them.

First of all, zoos are like a safe place for animals. They provide a habitat for animals that are endangered or threatened in the wild. For example, zoos have helped to protect the giant panda, which is like super endangered. They also help to breed animals in captivity so that they can be released into the wild and help increase their populations. This is important because it helps to keep the animals from going extinct.

Another reason zoos are good is that they help us learn about animals. They provide a place for people to see animals up close and personal, which can help us appreciate them more. When we see animals in person, it makes us realize how important they are and how we need to protect them. Zoos also have educational programs and activities that teach us about animals and conservation. This can help us make informed decisions about how to protect animals and their habitats.

Zoos also help to support conservation efforts. Many zoos have conservation programs that help protect animals in the wild. For example, some zoos have programs that help protect marine life, like dolphins and sea turtles. These programs can help us learn about the animals and their habitats, and how to protect them from threats like pollution and overfishing.

However, some people think that zoos are cruel and that we shouldn't keep animals in captivity. They say that zoos are like prisons for animals and that they're not natural habitats. But, I think that zoos are like a necessary evil. They help us protect animals and learn about them, which is important for conservation. And, many zoos are working to improve their habitats and make them more natural for the animals. They're also working to reduce stress and improve the welfare of the animals.

In conclusion, zoos are important for conservation and education. They provide a safe place for animals, help us learn about them, and support conservation efforts. While some people may think that zoos are cruel, I think that they're necessary to help protect animals and their habitats.

In today's world, cell phones have become ubiquitous. Nearly everyone owns a smartphone and uses it throughout the day for a variety of tasks like checking emails, browsing social media, taking photos, and making calls. However, while cell phones have brought many conveniences to modern life, they have also introduced significant risks when used while driving. For this reason, drivers should not be permitted to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.

There are several compelling safety reasons why cell phone use, even hands-free, poses too great a risk while driving. Using a cell phone requires taking one's eyes off the road for periods of time. Even brief glances away to check notifications or controls on a mounted phone can be dangerous as road and traffic conditions can change rapidly. Numerous studies have also found that cell phone conversations require partial attention and cognitive focus, diverting mental resources away from the critical task of vehicle operation. This impairment is comparable to the effects of alcohol intoxication on driving ability. Furthermore, texting while driving is prohibitively unsafe as it requires visual attention be directed to the phone instead of the road for extended periods of time.

Banning all cell phone use would significantly reduce accidents caused by driver distraction and inattention. The United States and many other countries have already enacted ""no cell phones"" laws for good reason - research shows these types of policies reduce crashes. Allowing some cell phone activity also complicates enforcement of laws. It may be difficult for law enforcement to determine if a driver was using a phone to text/call or otherwise interact with it. For the sake of safety and enforceability, a total cell phone ban achieves the best outcome.

In conclusion, while cell phones have benefited society in many ways, they introduce too much risk on roads when used by drivers. Lives and public safety should take priority over any conveniences of cell phone operability during vehicle operation. For these reasons, drivers should refrain from all cell phone activity to ensure full attention is directed to the vital task of driving.

B7F56382EF7D,"Introduction
Life’s important matters pertain to those decisions in life which have a major effect on our existence. This could be life-changing decisions such as purchasing a home, financial investments, life partner, or parenting decisions. In these circumstances, it is paramount that people understand the importance of making their own decisions. 

Profitability of Making Your Own Decisions 
The advantages of making your own decision when it comes to important matters is that it saves a person both time and money. For example, if one was to buy a car, he/she may have an idea of how much to spend and needs to understand the best way to leverage it. By taking the initiative and making the decision himself/herself, the person can be sure that they are getting maximum value for their money. Additionally, by making a responsible and intelligent decision, the person can ensure a healthier financial future for themself and their families. 

Unhealthy Decisions from Experts 
At times, people take advice from external sources such as professional advisors to help them make decisions on important matters. However, this may not always be in a person’s best interest as the potential exists for them to be given bad financial advice. In these cases, they need to make sure that they are making an independent decision which is free from external influences.

darragh_claude_v7_663,"Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to express my views on the proposed policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While I understand the goal of wanting students to focus on their academics, I do not think requiring a B average is fair or will have the intended effect. 

There are several reasons why this proposed change concerns me. Firstly, not all students learn in the same way or at the same pace. For some students, hand-on learning or activities help them stay motivated to do better in their academic classes. By taking away sports and clubs, those students may lose an important factor that helps them succeed. It could potentially cause their grades to drop instead of improve without the extracurricular outlet. 

Secondly, extracurriculars teach important life lessons like teamwork, leadership, time management that cannot be learned inside the classroom. Limiting participation only to students with high grades takes away these learning opportunities from other students. It is unfair to punish students who work hard but may struggle more with academics by not letting them be part of a team. 

Finally, there is a concern this policy could have the opposite effect than intended. Students who are on the border of a B average may feel it is not worth the effort if they risk losing their spot on a team. They may put less effort into their classes and grades could fall instead of rise. This would not benefit anyone. 

A better approach may be to put students on probation if their grades slip below a C. This allows them to improve with the support of extra time with teachers and tutors, instead of taking activities away as punishment. It also maintains important incentives for all students to work hard in school. 

In closing, while the goal of high academic achievement is important, requiring a B average seems too extreme and could backfire. I hope the concerns I have outlined will be considered in reviewing this proposed policy change. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my argument.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

[Your name]",darragh_claude_v7,1,0.0,"Dear Principal Smith, I am writing to express my views on the proposed policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While I understand the goal of wanting students to focus on their academics, I do not think requiring a B average is fair or will have the intended effect. There are several reasons why this proposed change concerns me. Firstly, not all students learn in the same way or at the same pace. For some students, handon learning or activities help them stay motivated to do better in their academic classes. By taking away sports and clubs, those students may lose an important factor that helps them succeed. It could potentially cause their grades to drop instead of improve without the extracurricular outlet. Secondly, extracurriculars teach important life lessons like teamwork, leadership, time management that cannot be learned inside the classroom.

92CD1BD0C18F," A positive attitude is one of the most crucial elements in achieving success and fulfillment in life. It is the foundation upon which we build our relationships, our careers, and our personal growth. When we approach challenges and opportunities with a positive attitude, we open ourselves up to endless possibilities and create a positive impact on those around us.

On the other hand, a negative attitude can be a barrier to success. It can lead to feelings of hopelessness, self-doubt, and a lack of motivation. People who consistently exhibit a negative attitude often struggle to achieve their goals and may even sabotage their own success.

For example, consider a salesperson who consistently receives rejections from potential clients. If they approach each rejection with a positive attitude, they may see it as an opportunity to learn and improve. They may use the feedback to refine their pitch and better understand their target audience. On the other hand, if they approach each rejection with a negative attitude, they may become discouraged and give up on their sales efforts altogether.

Similarly, in personal relationships, a positive attitude can help to build trust, respect, and intimacy. When we approach our partners with a positive attitude, we are more likely to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts peacefully, and create a strong foundation for a healthy and fulfilling relationship.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is essential for achieving success and fulfillment in all areas of life. It helps us to approach challenges and opportunities with an open mind, a sense of curiosity, and a willingness to learn and grow.

darragh_claude_v7_876,"While technology to identify emotions could potentially provide insights, there are significant concerns about using FACS monitoring of students in the classroom. 

On one hand, emotional tracking could help teachers understand how their lessons impact students. Noticing boredom or frustration may prompt adjustments to improve learning. However, this type of surveillance also raises serious ethical and practical issues. 

Continuous facial scanning would invade students' privacy and remove their autonomy over self-expression. Children should feel comfortable exploring new ideas without scrutiny of each fleeting reaction. Emotions are also complex - the same expression could indicate different internal experiences based on context. Automated labeling may oversimplify what students experience. 

Teachers already have useful tools for assessing engagement through participation, questions, and one-on-one conversations. Relying too much on tech monitoring could shift focus from academic content to surface behaviors in a way that fails to support individual student needs. It may even backfire by making some children self-conscious or discouraged from taking risks in the classroom. 

Overall, facial monitoring lacks the nuance of human judgment and relationships. While the technology aims to provide insights, the weaknesses outweigh potential benefits for education settings at this time. A better approach is for teachers to get to know each student as a whole person and adjust practices through open communication and respect for student well-being, not constant emotional surveillance.

School is more than just a place to learn, it's a place to discover, inspire, and empower students to achieve their goals. From school, students can gain not only academic knowledge but also life experiences that go beyond the pages of a book. Additionally, school is a crucial place for students to evaluate their skills and abilities, and to help them make informed decisions about their future.

One of the benefits of extracurricular activities is that they provide students with opportunities to explore their passions and interests. School is a place where students can discover new things and pursue their dreams. For example, a student who is interested in photography can take a photography class and learn new skills, techniques, and perspectives. Similarly, a student who is interested in music can join a band or choir and develop their musical talent. These activities not only provide students with a sense of fulfillment and joy but also help them to build their confidence and self-esteem.

Another benefit of extracurricular activities is that they provide students with a sense of community and belonging. Students can connect with others who share their interests and passions, and they can learn from each other. This sense of community can also extend beyond the classroom and help students to build lasting friendships.

However, not all students have the same opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. Some students may not have the financial means to participate in certain activities, while others may face pressure from their parents or family to pursue certain careers. In some cases, parents may force their children to take classes or pursue careers that they are not interested in, simply because they believe it will lead to financial success. This can be emotionally damaging for the student and can lead to a lack of fulfillment and happiness.

Schools can play a crucial role in supporting students' involvement in extracurricular activities. By providing students with access to a variety of activities and resources, schools can help to ensure that all students have the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests. Additionally, schools can work with families to help students make informed decisions about their involvement in extracurricular activities, and to provide support and guidance as needed.

F4FC2D64C127,"Regular inactive times are crucial for maintaining good health and well-being. In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to become overwhelmed by work, school, and other responsibilities, leading to a lack of time for rest and relaxation. However, research has shown that regular inactive times can have numerous benefits, including a longer life, fresh ideas, and more energy.

One real-life example of the danger of not having regular inactive times is the case of a person who works long hours without taking any breaks. This person may experience physical and mental exhaustion, leading to a decline in productivity and overall health. In fact, studies have shown that individuals who work long hours without taking breaks are at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.

On the other hand, having regular inactive times can have numerous benefits. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals recharge their batteries and improve their focus and productivity. Additionally, regular inactive times can help individuals develop fresh ideas and creative solutions to problems. Research has also shown that individuals who take regular breaks are at a lower risk of developing chronic diseases and have a longer lifespan.

Personally, I have experienced the benefits of regular inactive times. When I take regular breaks throughout the day, I feel more energized and focused, and I am able to accomplish more in less time. Additionally, taking regular breaks has helped me develop new ideas and solutions to problems I was facing at work.

Regular inactive times can also help individuals achieve their goals. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals reduce stress and improve their overall well-being, leading to a better quality of life.

llama_70b_v138,"Dear Principal,

I think that the policy change that you are thinking about is a good idea. I know that some people might think it's unfair, but I think it's important for students to have good grades if they want to participate in sports or other activities.

First of all, having good grades is important for students because it shows that they are responsible and can handle their work. If a student is not doing well in school, they might not be able to handle the commitment of being on a sports team or in a club. It's not fair to the other students who are working hard and have good grades to have someone on the team who is not pulling their weight.

Secondly, having good grades can help students get into college. A lot of colleges look at grades when they are deciding who to accept. If a student has bad grades, they might not get into the college they want to go to. By requiring students to have at least a grade B average, it will motivate them to work harder and get better grades.

Finally, having good grades can help students in the long run. When students have good grades, they are more likely to get a good job. Employers look at grades when they are hiring people. If a student has bad grades, they might not get the job they want. By requiring students to have at least a grade B average, it will help them in the long run.

I know that some students might say that this policy is unfair because some students might not be able to participate in sports or other activities. But, I think it's important for students to have good grades. If a student is not able to get at least a grade B average, they might not be able to participate in sports or other activities, but they can still participate in other ways, like clubs or volunteer work.

In conclusion, I think that requiring students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is a good idea. It will help students be more responsible, get into college, and have better grades in the long run.

falcon_180b_v1_137,"Gun control is a highly controversial issue in many countries, and it's no surprise that people have varying opinions on the matter. Personally, I believe that stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure public safety and prevent unnecessary loss of life.

Firstly, stricter gun control laws will help reduce the number of gun-related deaths and injuries. In countries with lenient gun control laws, it's often much easier for people to obtain firearms, and this has resulted in an alarming number of shootings and other violent crimes. For instance, in the US, which has some of the most lax gun laws in the developed world, an estimated 100 people die from gun-related injuries each day. This is a shocking statistic and highlights the need for more restrictive gun control measures.

Additionally, stricter gun control laws can help prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals and those with a history of violence. By requiring background checks, waiting periods, and other measures, we can reduce the likelihood that dangerous individuals will be able to acquire firearms. For example, in Australia, where the government implemented strict gun control measures following a mass shooting in the 90s, there has been a significant reduction in gun-related deaths and crimes.

Furthermore, stricter gun control laws can help protect children from accidental gun injuries and deaths. Each year, hundreds of children are injured or killed in accidental shootings. This is a heartbreaking reality, and we need to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent these incidents from happening. Stricter gun control measures, such as safe storage requirements and mandatory training for gun owners, can go a long way toward achieving this goal.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are essential to ensuring public safety and reducing gun-related deaths, injuries, and crimes. By implementing sensible gun control measures, we can help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands, protect our children from harm, and create safer communities for everyone. We can no longer afford to ignore the issue of gun control and must take action to address it.",falcon_180b_v1,1,0.0,"Gun control is a highly controversial issue in many countries, and it's no surprise that people have varying opinions on the matter.

A9E9851F3E7E," In recent years, distance learning has become a popular option for students to attend classes remotely through online or video conferencing. While some parents may believe that distance learning is beneficial for students to stay at home for education, there are several reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is that students may become too comfortable with the convenience of attending classes from home, leading to a lack of motivation and discipline. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on top of their work and may be more likely to procrastinate or miss assignments. Additionally, students may become isolated from their peers and may miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes in person.

The second reason is that distance learning can be challenging for students who require additional support or accommodations. For example, students with disabilities may have difficulty accessing online materials or participating in virtual discussions. Additionally, students who are struggling academically may benefit from the one-on-one support and guidance provided by a teacher in a traditional classroom setting.

The third reason is that distance learning can be expensive for both students and parents. While some schools may offer free or low-cost distance learning options, students may still need to purchase textbooks or other materials, which can add up over time. Additionally, parents may have to pay for internet access or other technology costs, which can be a significant expense for families on a tight budget.

In conclusion, while distance learning may seem like a convenient option for some students, there are several reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

From a student attendance perspective, this schedule could lead to increased absenteeism as students may need to juggle family matters on their long days off, such as childcare. Furthermore, this model could prove overly taxing on students, leading to increased stress levels. On the other hand, an extended school day could enable students to benefit from a more robust curriculum, with longer periods for more complex concepts. Additionally, this approach might be an attractive option for students who have part-time jobs or extracurricular commitments, as they would have longer days off.

Overall, while a four-day school week with ten hour days may have some benefits, they should be balanced with its drawbacks. It is important to remember that while increased flexibility may be a positive aspect, students must be able to cope with the extended days and additional academic demands.

Community service allows students to give back to their community and make a positive impact on the world. By volunteering their time and resources, they can help those in need and make a real difference in people's lives. This experience can also help students develop important skills such as leadership, teamwork, and empathy.

Furthermore, community service can also help students develop a sense of responsibility and accountability. When students are required to participate in community service, they learn to take ownership of their actions and the impact they have on others. This can help them become more well-rounded individuals and better citizens.

On the other hand, some may argue that community service is too much work and takes away from students' academic pursuits. While it is true that community service requires time and effort, it can also be a valuable learning experience.

E2456BDC6648," The adoption of a four-day school week and the addition of two extra hours to the regular school day can have a significant impact on the conservation of energy and resources. By reducing the number of school days, we can reduce the amount of energy consumed in the school building, including the use of lights, computers, and laptops. Additionally, students will be able to save time and money on transportation, as they will not need to come to school on Fridays.

Furthermore, the adoption of a four-day school week can also have a positive impact on students' well-being. By having an extra day off each week, students can spend more time with their families, engage in hobbies and activities, and take a break from the stress of school. This can lead to improved mental health and overall happiness.

In addition, students who currently work part-time jobs will be able to work more hours during the four-day school week. This can lead to increased income and a better work-life balance. For students who do not work part-time, the extra day off can provide an opportunity to catch up on homework, work on projects, and spend time with friends and family.

However, some students may argue that adding two extra hours to the regular school day will make them more exhausted and will have less time to work in their part-time jobs. While this may be a concern, it is important to consider the long-term benefits of adopting a four-day school week, including the conservation of energy and resources, improved well-being, and increased income opportunities.

The pursuit of a successful career after graduation is a crucial aspect of a student's life. Many students find themselves wondering when is the right time to commit to a career path, with some choosing to wait until after graduation, while others decide to commit early on. While there are advantages to both approaches, it is ultimately beneficial for students to commit to a career at a young age.

One of the main advantages of committing to a career early on is that it allows students to have a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations for that particular career. By knowing what courses are necessary, students can focus their academic efforts on ensuring they have the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their desired field. This can lead to a more efficient and effective education, as students are able to tailor their studies to their future goals.

Additionally, committing to a career early on can help students to avoid the stress and uncertainty that can come with trying to decide what to do after graduation. With a clear understanding of their desired career path, students can focus their efforts on preparing for their future, rather than worrying about what to do next. This can lead to a more fulfilling and successful career, as students are able to hit the ground running and start building their skills and experience from day one.

Finally, committing to a career early on can also provide students with the opportunity to develop the fundamental skills and knowledge needed for their desired field. Whether it is through internships, research projects, or other experiential learning opportunities, students can gain valuable experience and develop the skills they need to succeed in their career. This can give them a head start over their peers, and help them to stand out in a competitive job market.

In conclusion, committing to a career early on can provide students with numerous benefits, including a clear understanding of the requirements and expectations for their desired field, reduced stress and uncertainty, and the opportunity to develop fundamental skills and knowledge. While there may be advantages to waiting until after graduation to commit to a career, the benefits of committing early on are too great to ignore.

The potential use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read student emotions in the classroom warrants careful consideration. On one hand, such technology could provide teachers valuable insight into how students are processing new information and feeling in real time. Knowing when students are confused, bored, or engaging could help teachers tailor their lessons more effectively. However, this technology may also cross lines and undermine student privacy. 

Constant monitoring of facial expressions and emotions could feel invasive to students and damage the relationship of trust between teachers and students. Rather than focusing on the objective of learning, students may feel like they are being studied or judged based on fleeting facial reactions outside of their control. Students should feel comfortable taking risks, asking questions freely, and processing ideas as they work through challenges of learning without worrying their every expression will be recorded and analyzed.

Additionally, facial coding technology is still developing and may not accurately interpret emotions in all cases. Subtle facial cues alone do not always reflect a student's full experience in the moment or overall understanding. There is a risk that teachers or administrators could make assumptions about a student's engagement or comprehension based on automated readings that do not tell the whole story. Before widespread use, more research needs to be done to test the reliability of this technology in educational settings and address privacy and consent considerations. 

In conclusion, while facial recognition aimed at improving instruction has potential benefits, the drawbacks of invading student privacy and creating an evaluative environment pose serious risks that need to be mitigated. If concerns can be addressed through developing the technology's capabilities, obtaining consent, and implementing proper safeguards and oversight, it may become a valuable tool when used sparingly and for diagnostic purposes only.

Then there's like, tech careers.  Like, software engineers and app developers and stuff. They're always in demand and they make good money too. Plus, I'm pretty good at coding and stuff, so that could be a good option. 

But, I also wanna consider careers that are like, more creative and stuff. Like, graphic designers and writers and stuff. They get to be artistic and express themselves, and they can work from home or freelance.  That sounds pretty cool.

I'm also gonna talk to my parents and teachers about this. They'll have some good advice and stuff.  They'll probably tell me to follow my passion and stuff, but I'm like, not sure what my passion is yet.

darragh_claude_v7_759,"I agree with the principal's decision that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. There are several benefits for students engaging in extracurriculars.

Participating in extracurricular activities allows students to explore their interests and discover new passions. By trying different clubs and sports, students have an opportunity to find an activity they truly enjoy and excel at. This can help students develop skills and talents they may not realize they have. Extracurriculars also help students learn time management. Being part of a team or club means taking responsibility for commitments outside of classwork. Students must learn to balance their obligations and schedule practice/meeting times. This teaches important life skills. 

Extracurricular activities also have social benefits. Through group activities, students can make new friends and strengthen their social skills. Interacting with peers and coaches in a fun environment makes it easier for students to come out of their shell. Many lifelong friendships are formed through shared extracurricular experiences. Participating may also have mental health benefits. Research shows that students involved in extracurriculars have lower rates of depression and anxiety. Having an outlet can help students cope with academic stress.

Requiring participation also opens doors to future opportunities. Colleges seek well-rounded students who contribute to their school in different ways.

F52394B3500C," I believe that schools should not adopt the business model when it comes to their schedules. Adding two more hours to the day is not worth it for various reasons. For one, students have other activities outside of school that they need to attend to, such as going to the gym or participating in sports. By adding two more hours to the school day, students may not have enough time to engage in these activities, which can lead to a decrease in their overall well-being.

Moreover, some students work after school, and adding two more hours to the school day can negatively impact their ability to make money. These students may not have enough time to work, which can lead to a decrease in their income and financial stability. Additionally, staying on school for two more hours can be challenging for students who have to take care of their households, such as making their siblings food and cleaning their homes. This can be a difficult task, and adding two more hours to the school day can make it even more challenging.

Furthermore, adding two more hours to the school day may not be beneficial for all students. For instance, students who do not have any extracurricular activities or work after school may not see any significant benefits from having two more hours in the school day. These students can still learn and focus on their schoolwork during the regular school hours.

In conclusion, schools should not follow the business model when it comes to their schedules. Adding two more hours to the school day may not be beneficial for all students, and it can negatively impact their ability to engage in other activities outside of school.

falcon_180b_v1_407,"I believe that summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. The purpose of summer projects is to encourage students to take responsibility for their own learning and to pursue their interests independently. By allowing students to design their own projects, they are given the opportunity to explore topics that are meaningful to them, which will make the learning experience more enjoyable and engaging.

When students are given the freedom to design their own projects, they are more likely to be invested in the outcome. They will take pride in their work and be more motivated to see it through to completion. Moreover, students who are passionate about a particular subject are more likely to produce high-quality work that goes beyond what is expected of them.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can often feel like busywork. Students may not see the value in the project and may not be motivated to complete it. This can lead to a lackluster outcome, which does not help the student learn or grow.

For example, in my high school, students were required to complete a summer project in their English class. Some students were given a list of topics to choose from, while others were free to design their own topic. The students who designed their own topics produced work that was much more creative and interesting than those who simply chose from the list. They were able to incorporate their own interests and passions into their projects, which made the learning experience more meaningful.

Overall, I believe that student-designed summer projects are the way to go. They encourage students to take ownership of their own learning and provide an opportunity for them to pursue their own interests. While it may require more effort on the part of the student, the end result will be a more meaningful learning experience that will help them grow as individuals.",falcon_180b_v1,1,0.0,"I believe that summer projects should be studentdesigned rather than teacherdesigned.

llama_70b_v1481,"Zoos have been a controversial topic for a long time. While some people believe that zoos are essential for conservation and education, others argue that they are cruel and unethical. In my opinion, zoos should continue to operate because of their role in conservation and education.

Firstly, zoos play a vital role in conservation. They provide a safe place for animals to breed and live, especially for those that are endangered or threatened. For example, zoos have helped to increase the population of giant pandas, which are an endangered species. Additionally, zoos can help to reintroduce animals into the wild. For instance, the California condor was once considered extinct, but thanks to breeding programs in zoos, it has been reintroduced into the wild.

Secondly, zoos are essential for education. They provide people with an opportunity to learn about animals that they may not have seen before. Zoos can teach people about the importance of conservation and the need to protect animals and their habitats. For example, many zoos have educational programs that teach children about the effects of pollution on wildlife.

Furthermore, zoos can also help to promote scientific research. Scientists can study animals in zoos to learn more about their behavior, habitat, and diet. This information can be used to develop conservation strategies and to improve animal welfare.

However, I understand that some people argue that zoos are cruel and unethical. They believe that keeping animals in enclosures is not natural and can cause stress and harm to the animals. For example, some animals may develop abnormal behaviors, such as pacing or self-mutilation, due to the lack of space and stimulation.

To address these concerns, many zoos are working to improve animal welfare. They are providing larger enclosures and more natural habitats for the animals. Additionally, zoos are also working to reduce the number of animals that are taken from the wild. They are instead breeding animals in captivity, which helps to reduce the demand for wild animals.

In conclusion, while there are some valid concerns about zoos, I believe that they play a vital role in conservation and education. By providing safe habitats for animals, promoting scientific research, and educating the public, zoos can help to protect animals and their habitats.

CDAA99F49D42,"Graduating from high school in three years instead of four has become a popular trend among students. While there are benefits to graduating early, there are also drawbacks. In this essay, we will explore the advantages and disadvantages of graduating early and examine real-life examples of students who have taken advantage of early graduation programs.

One benefit of graduating early is that it allows students to enter the workforce or attend college sooner. This can be advantageous for students who want to start their careers or attend college right away. Additionally, graduating early can save students money on tuition and living expenses. For example, a student who graduates in three years instead of four will have completed their undergraduate degree in less time, which can result in lower student loan payments.

However, graduating early can also have drawbacks. One potential disadvantage is that students may not be fully prepared for the workforce or college. Graduating early may mean that students have not had the same amount of time to develop important skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. Additionally, some employers may view graduating early as a negative, as it may indicate a lack of dedication or commitment to education.

District high schools often offer programs to assist students in graduating early. These programs typically involve taking advanced courses and completing coursework in less time than the traditional four years. For example, some schools offer accelerated programs that allow students to graduate in three years. These programs often require students to take rigorous coursework and may involve online or night classes.

Online classes and night school can also be effective solutions for students who want to graduate early. These classes can be taken at the student's own pace, allowing them to complete coursework faster than they would in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, online classes can be more flexible, as students can complete coursework from anywhere with an internet connection.

However, there are also drawbacks to taking online classes and night school. One potential disadvantage is that these classes can be more challenging than traditional classes. Students may struggle with the self-discipline required to complete coursework on their own schedule.

llama_70b_v11120,"Governments Should Take Immediate Action to Address Climate Change

Climate change has become a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and action from governments worldwide. The scientific evidence is clear: human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures, more frequent natural disasters, and devastating consequences for our planet and its inhabitants. In this essay, I will argue for the idea that governments should take immediate action to address climate change, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

First and foremost, climate change poses an existential threat to our planet. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report warns that we have only a few years to act before the damage becomes irreversible. Rising temperatures are melting polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise, and altering weather patterns, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and storms. The consequences of inaction are dire: more frequent and intense natural disasters, displacement of millions of people, and irreparable damage to ecosystems and biodiversity.

Secondly, the economic benefits of taking action on climate change far outweigh the costs. Investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, creates new jobs and stimulates economic growth while reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Moreover, the cost of inaction is staggering: climate-related disasters have already caused billions of dollars in damage, and this number is expected to increase exponentially if we fail to act. According to the United Nations, the world needs to invest at least $1.9 trillion each year in clean energy and other mitigation efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Thirdly, governments have a moral obligation to act on climate change. Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations, including low-income communities, indigenous peoples, and small island nations. These communities have contributed the least to the problem but are bearing the brunt of its consequences. By taking action on climate change, governments can demonstrate their commitment to protecting the rights and well-being of their citizens.

Finally, there are many examples of successful climate action that governments can draw inspiration from. Costa Rica, for instance, has been running on 100% renewable energy for over a year, demonstrating that it is possible to transition to a clean energy economy. Similarly, China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has committed to peak its emissions by 2030 and is investing heavily in renewable energy. Closer to home, many cities and states have implemented policies to reduce their carbon footprint, such as investing in public transportation, promoting energy-efficient buildings, and implementing carbon pricing.

In conclusion, climate change is an urgent issue that requires immediate action from governments worldwide. The scientific evidence is clear, the economic benefits of action are compelling, and the moral obligation to act is indisputable. There are many successful examples of climate action that governments can learn from, and the time to act is now. We cannot afford to wait any longer.

6D114CB7EBB3,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that individual character is formed by influences beyond an individual's control. This concept is reflected in the quote ""It is not what we have, but what we use, that makes us rich"" by John Lubbock.

Firstly, Lubbock's quote emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility in shaping one's character. The phrase ""It is not what we have, but what we use"" suggests that having wealth or material possessions does not automatically make a person rich. Instead, it is how a person uses their resources that ultimately determines their character. For example, a person who uses their resources to help others and make a positive impact on the world is truly rich, even if they do not have a lot of money.

Secondly, Lubbock's quote highlights the idea that our environment and upbringing can greatly influence our character. The phrase ""It is not what we have, but what we use"" implies that the resources and opportunities available to us are not entirely within our control. For example, a person who grew up in poverty may not have had access to the same resources and opportunities as someone who grew up in wealth. However, this does not mean that their character is predetermined. Instead, it is up to each individual to use the resources they have to the best of their ability and shape their character accordingly.

Finally, Lubbock's quote suggests that individual character is not fixed, but rather constantly evolving. The phrase ""It is not what we have, but what we use"" implies that our character is shaped by our actions and choices, and can change over time. For example, a person who once used their resources selfishly may eventually learn to use them in a more selfless way, leading to a change in their character.

0e3cdc0ef07e_04112023,"Dear Principal Johnson, 

I am writing to share my views on whether community service should be required for all students. I believe that making community service mandatory would greatly benefit both our students and the community. 

There are many positive impacts that result from volunteering. Students who participate in service learning have shown improved academic performance and increased civic responsibility. When students spend time helping others, they gain real-world experience and career exposure that cannot be found in a classroom. Volunteering also allows students to explore personal interests and strengths outside of academics. Most importantly, community service fosters empathy and compassion for those in need. It teaches participants the value of giving back.

Requiring community service would not be an unreasonable demand on students' time. Projects could be fulfilled over weekends or school breaks to avoid interfering with regular course loads and extracurricular activities. Many service opportunities, such as tutoring or park cleanup, only require a few hours each month. With some organization, all students should be able to complete their hours without too much disruption to their schedules. 

While volunteering is a choice for some, making it mandatory ensures that the benefits of service are available to all students, not just those who are naturally inclined to help others. A community service requirement demonstrates our school's commitment to developing socially responsible graduates. It also strengthens our relationships with community partners by providing a reliable pool of volunteers.

In closing, I believe the rewards of community service, both for students and for the community, fully justify making it a requirement for graduation. Participating in volunteer work is an important part of every student's development into an active, compassionate citizen. For all these reasons, I encourage you to mandate community service for all students.

3448f48efed1_04112023,"Limiting car usage has numerous benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. Reducing reliance on personal vehicles can positively impact environmental sustainability, public health, and urban infrastructure. 

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is improved environmental sustainability. Automobiles are a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. According to Passage 1, transportation accounts for over a quarter of total U.S. carbon emissions. By driving less and utilizing alternative modes of transportation like public transit, biking, or walking, individuals can significantly lower their personal carbon footprint. This reduction in vehicle emissions would help mitigate the impacts of climate change. Limiting car usage would also lessen other forms of pollution like smog and toxic particulate matter from tailpipes, creating healthier air for communities.

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car usage promotes public health. As noted in Passage 2, sedentary transportation like driving encourages a more sedentary lifestyle with negative health outcomes. Opting for active transit like biking or walking whenever possible allows individuals to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Regular exercise through active transportation can help reduce risks for obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. On a systemic level, less congestion and more physical activity would benefit public health outcomes for entire urban populations. 

Finally, reducing car dependency can positively impact urban infrastructure and city planning. According to Passage 3, personal vehicles consume a disproportionate amount of urban land through roads, parking lots and driveways. By utilizing alternatives to driving, cities would need fewer roads, parking spaces and related infrastructure. This opened up land could be repurposed for parks, affordable housing or other public uses that improve quality of life. Active transit would also lessen traffic congestion, reducing commuting stresses and improving pedestrian and cyclist safety.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through individual behavior changes and shifts in societal priorities would create widespread environmental, health and infrastructural advantages. Minor reductions in driving, even if adopted gradually, could make significant impacts if embraced widely. Overall, curbing car dependency represents a practical strategy for building a more sustainable, healthy and livable future.",darragh_claude_v6,1,0.0,"Limiting car usage has numerous benefits for both individuals and society as a whole.

darragh_claude_v7_129,"While cell phones have become a ubiquitous part of modern life, using a cell phone while driving poses significant risks and distractions that endanger drivers and others on the road. For this reason, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle.

There are several reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel is dangerous. First and foremost, cell phones require the user's attention and focus to operate. Whether dialing a number, texting, or engaging in a call, the cognitive effort required draws eyes and mental attention away from the critical task of driving. Numerous studies have shown that even hands-free calling significantly increases distracted driving risks by engrossing the mind with conversations instead of the road.

Additionally, the manual action of holding and touching a cell phone removes the hands from the wheel where they need to be for steering control. Texting is an especially perilous activity that divides attention between the phone screen and the roadway. Attempting to type or read messages demands vision be directed downward instead of focused ahead for hazard detection. Speed and following distance often suffer as a result of cell phone distractions as well. 

Furthermore, cell phone use raises the risk of accidents substantially. Research shows drivers who use phones are four times more likely to be involved in a crash serious enough to injure themselves. As vehicles weighing several tons traveling at highway speeds, even a moment of diverted attention can have catastrophic outcomes by contributing to rear-end collisions or swerving into other lanes. Lives are at stake with each cell phone interaction at the wheel.

In order to prioritize safety on roads shared by all, a total ban on cell phone manipulation while driving is sensible and justified. Exceptions that still demand manual or visual engagement are not recommended. Hands-free use may be marginally safer but still increases cognitive distraction. For the protection of others and enforcement practicality, a clear, broad restriction is most advisable. Driver attention needs to stay focused solely on the dynamic task of navigating vehicles, not divided between phones and the roadway. In today's wireless age, brief calls or messages can always wait until the driver reaches a safe stopping point if they cannot wait.

For this reason, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity when operating a vehicle. There are several reasons why cell phone use behind the wheel is dangerous. First and foremost, cell phones require the user's attention and focus to operate. Whether dialing a number, texting, or engaging in a call, the cognitive effort required draws eyes and mental attention away from the critical task of driving. Numerous studies have shown that even handsfree calling significantly increases distracted driving risks by engrossing the mind with conversations instead of the road. Additionally, the manual action of holding and touching a cell phone removes the hands from the wheel where they need to be for steering control. Texting is an especially perilous activity that divides attention between the phone screen and the roadway. Attempting to type or read messages demands vision be directed downward instead of focused ahead for hazard detection.

Like, he was the third President of the United States, but he also wrote the Declaration of Independence!  That's like, the most important document in American history, right? 

But, like, Jefferson wasn't just a political dude. He was also a total bookworm. He loved reading and learning, and he had like, a huge library at his house. He believed in the power of education, and he thought that everyone should have access to it.  That's pretty cool, right?

And, like, Jefferson was also a total abolitionist. He believed that slavery was wrong, and he tried to do stuff to help the slaves. He even wrote a letter to a slave owner, telling him to free his slaves.  That's like, super brave, right?

But, like, Jefferson wasn't perfect. He had some, like, controversial views on stuff. He believed in the separation of church and state, but he also believed in the power of the people.  That's like, kinda weird, right?

Anyway, like, his accomplishments and approaches to life have totally benefitted society. He believed in the power of education and the importance of standing up for what's right.  And, like, his ideas have influenced a lot of people, even today.

While experts may have knowledge and experience in their respective fields, they may not always have the best understanding of an individual's unique circumstances and goals. Additionally, relying solely on the opinions of experts can limit personal growth and development.

Firstly, experts may not always have the best understanding of an individual's unique circumstances and goals. For example, a financial expert may provide advice that is not tailored to an individual's specific financial situation. This can lead to poor financial decisions and missed opportunities. Similarly, a career expert may provide advice that does not align with an individual's personal values and interests. In these cases, it is important for individuals to make their own decisions based on their own research and understanding of their situation.

Secondly, relying solely on the opinions of experts can limit personal growth and development. When individuals rely solely on the opinions of experts, they may not develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary to make informed decisions. This can lead to a lack of personal responsibility and a lack of confidence in one's own abilities. On the other hand, when individuals make their own decisions, they have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and grow as individuals.

Finally, experts may not always have the best interests of the individual at heart. For example, a doctor may recommend a treatment that is not the best option for a patient's specific health needs. This can lead to unnecessary suffering and a lack of trust in the medical profession. Similarly, a lawyer may recommend a course of action that is not in the best interest of their client.

B76C582FA08B,"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that teachers should allow students to use their cell phones during classes. While some people argue that cell phones are a distraction and can negatively impact a student's academic performance, I believe that with proper guidelines and restrictions in place, cell phones can be a valuable tool for learning.

Firstly, cell phones are a vital part of a student's life. They are used for communication, research, and organization. Allowing students to use their cell phones during class can help them stay connected with their teachers and classmates, even if they are not physically present in the classroom. This can be especially beneficial for students who have difficulty staying organized or communicating effectively.

Secondly, cell phones can be used as a tool for learning. Many educational apps and websites are available that can help students learn new concepts and reinforce their understanding of material. Allowing students to use their cell phones during class can provide them with additional resources to help them succeed in their studies.

However, it is important to have proper guidelines and restrictions in place to ensure that cell phones are used appropriately during class. Teachers should set clear rules regarding when and where cell phones can be used, and students should be required to turn off their phones during class to minimize distractions. Additionally, teachers should monitor the use of cell phones during class to ensure that students are using them for educational purposes and not engaging in inappropriate behavior.

falcon_180b_v1_51,"I think it is a good idea for schools to allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. There are several reasons why I believe this.

First of all, it helps parents stay informed about their child's progress in school. If a student is struggling in a particular subject, the parent can identify this early on and work with the teacher to develop a plan to improve their child's performance. This can lead to better academic outcomes for the student.

Furthermore, online monitoring also promotes transparency and accountability. Teachers are more likely to keep accurate records of grades and attendance if they know that parents are able to access this information. This can help ensure that students are being fairly evaluated and that there are no discrepancies in the grading process.

Moreover, online monitoring can help foster a sense of responsibility in students. If they know that their parents are watching their progress, they may be more motivated to attend classes regularly and work hard to maintain good grades.

However, there are some potential downsides to this practice. For example, some students may feel pressured or anxious if they know their parents are constantly monitoring their grades and attendance. This could potentially have a negative impact on their mental health and overall well-being.

Additionally, there may be concerns about data privacy and security. Schools must ensure that sensitive student information is protected and that parents are only able to access their own child's records.

In conclusion, while there are some potential drawbacks to online monitoring of grades and attendance, I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks.

In Hawaii, I helped repair fences on a ranch high up on volcanic slopes, tougher conditions than I'd ever seen back home! But the camaraderie between the cowboys there and their strong work ethic felt familiar. In Australia, I gained immense respect for stations that operate on vast tracts of remote rangeland. Adapting cattle breeds and techniques to arid climates showed the resilience of ranchers worldwide. 

Most memorable were my conversations with Māori ranchers in New Zealand. Hearing how their cultural traditions blend with ranching tradtions was truly fascinating. We discovered shared values of hard work, respect for the land and animals. Meeting people proud of multigenerational ties to the ranch, as with my own family, strengthened my cowboy pride. The program also allowed me to fulfill my adventurous side, visiting Sydney's iconic Opera House and hiking through New Zealand's breathtaking landscapes.  

For any young rancher seeking an opportunity to serve our agriculture community while broadening your worldview, I encourage applying for the Seagoing Cowboys program.

8F16365E363D,"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and my school offers a distance learning program for students. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this program, compare online classes and video conferencing with traditional schooling, and provide a personal example that highlights the benefits of distance learning.

One of the biggest advantages of distance learning is the flexibility it provides. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which is especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as work or family. This flexibility allows students to balance their education with their other responsibilities, which can be difficult in traditional schooling.

Another advantage of distance learning is that it allows students to learn from anywhere with an internet connection. This means that students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially beneficial for those who live far away from their school or who have difficulty commuting to campus. Additionally, distance learning allows students to attend classes from any location that is conducive to their learning, such as a library or a quiet study space.

However, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. In traditional schooling, students have the opportunity to interact with their teachers and classmates on a daily basis, which can be beneficial for building relationships and getting help when needed. In distance learning, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their teachers and classmates, which can be difficult.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is the potential for distractions. When students are learning from home, they may be tempted to watch TV or play video games instead of focusing on their coursework. Additionally, students may struggle with staying organized and motivated when they are not physically present in a classroom.

In my personal experience, distance learning has been incredibly beneficial for me. When I was in high school, I had to commute an hour each day to school, which was difficult and time-consuming. However, when I started attending online classes in my freshman year of college, I was able to complete my coursework from the comfort of my own home.

DA26E5E2C08E," In my opinion, teenagers should have more flexibility in their curfew hours. While it is important for teenagers to have a sense of responsibility and to be accountable for their actions, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of having a strict curfew. For example, if a teenager has a job that requires them to work late, a curfew of 10 p. m may not be feasible. Additionally, if an emergency occurs at home or anywhere else, a teenager may not have someone to pick them up, and a curfew could make it even more difficult for them to get help.

Furthermore, during high school, teenagers have a lot of projects and tests that can be overwhelming. By allowing them to work and study later, they may be able to complete their work more effectively and achieve better grades in school. Additionally, many teenagers work to support their families, and a curfew could make it difficult for them to earn money or provide for their families.

It is also important to consider the potential consequences of a strict curfew on a teenager's mental health. Staying up late to complete work or study can be stressful, and a curfew could make it even more difficult for a teenager to manage their workload and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

In conclusion, while a curfew can be a useful tool for promoting responsibility and accountability, it is important to consider the potential consequences of a strict curfew.

7C6ED140EF65," It is important for individuals to take responsibility for their actions and decisions, and as such, there are many challenges that we must overcome to fulfill these responsibilities. A city council is currently considering the adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. While I understand the reasoning behind this proposal, I believe that it is misguided and will not effectively address the issues it aims to solve.

Firstly, the proposed curfews will have a significant impact on the lives of teenagers who have after-school activities or jobs. These activities and jobs are important to the development and well-being of young people, and restricting their ability to participate in them will not help them to reach their full potential. Additionally, many teenagers have to stay up late to complete schoolwork or study for exams, and a curfew would make it difficult for them to balance their responsibilities.

Secondly, the proposed curfews do not take into account the fact that teenagers are capable of staying up much longer than adults. While it is true that teenagers may stay up later than they should, this is not because they are bored or lack discipline, but because they are trying to prove their independence and responsibility. By imposing a curfew, the city council is essentially telling teenagers that they are not capable of making their own decisions and that they need to be controlled.

Finally, the proposed curfews do not address the root causes of the issues that they aim to solve. For example, the main reason why people are on the road at night is because they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. A curfew will not prevent this behavior, and in fact, it may even make it more dangerous. Additionally, the proposed curfews do not address the issue of deer or other dangerous animals that may be on the road at night.

A6A6C7852F05,"Introduction

First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that we have about someone or something when we first encounter it. These impressions are often based on our past experiences and biases, and can be influenced by factors such as appearance, behavior, and social status. While first impressions can be useful in certain situations, such as making quick decisions or forming initial judgments, they are not always accurate and can lead to misunderstandings and misjudgments. In this essay, I will argue that it is impossible to judge someone by their first impressions.

Body

First impressions are often based on superficial characteristics that do not accurately reflect a person's true character. For example, someone may be judged as outgoing and confident based on their appearance and demeanor, but in reality, they may be introverted and insecure. Similarly, someone may be judged as intelligent and successful based on their social status or occupation, but in reality, they may struggle with basic tasks or have financial difficulties. These examples demonstrate that first impressions can be misleading and do not provide a complete picture of a person's character.

Moreover, first impressions can be influenced by biases and stereotypes that can lead to unfair judgments. For instance, someone may be judged negatively based on their race, gender, or ethnicity, even if they have nothing to do with their character. These biases can also lead to assumptions about a person's abilities or intelligence, which can be detrimental to their self-esteem and opportunities.

Lastly, first impressions can be fleeting and easily forgotten, making it difficult to base important decisions or judgments on them. For example, a person may be judged as rude or unfriendly based on a brief interaction, but in reality, they may have been going through a difficult time or may have had a bad day. These fleeting impressions can lead to misunderstandings and damage relationships, as people may judge others based on their initial impressions without giving them a chance to explain themselves.

963501C88479,"Failure: The Unlikely Path to Success

As an 8th grader, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From botched science experiments to poorly written essays, I've learned that failure is an inevitable part of the learning process. But is failure truly a hindrance to success, or can it actually be a stepping stone towards it? In this essay, I'll explore the various views on the role of failure in the pursuit of success and share my own opinion on the matter.

On one hand, some people believe that failure is a necessary evil in the journey towards success. According to a popular saying, "" Failure is not the opposite of success, it's a part of success."" (Unknown). Failure allows us to learn from our mistakes, identify our weaknesses, and improve ourselves. For instance, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" By embracing failure, Edison was able to refine his ideas and ultimately achieve his goal.

On the other hand, some people believe that failure can be a major obstacle to success. When we fail, we may become discouraged and give up on our goals altogether. As the saying goes, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" (Winston Churchill). In this sense, failure can indeed be a roadblock to success, as it can erode our confidence and motivation.

However, I believe that failure can also be a catalyst for success. When we fail, we are given the opportunity to reflect on our actions, identify what went wrong, and make improvements. As the saying goes, ""The only way to do great work is to love what you do."" (Steve Jobs). If we are passionate about our goals, we are more likely to persevere through failure and keep working towards success.

In conclusion, failure is a complex and multifaceted concept that can have both positive and negative effects on the pursuit of success.

I think, umm, a lot of people are, like, trying to be something they're not, instead of just being themselves. Like, they see someone else who's successful or popular or whatever, and they're like, ""Oh, I want to be like them!"" But they're not really thinking about if that's what they truly want, or if they're just trying to impress others. And then they end up, like, miserable or something.

She's just doing it to make her parents happy or something. And I'm like, ""Dude, why are you doing this if you don't even care about it?""

BF2D36E0B64B,"Although numerous amounts of people want to banish the Electoral College, there are more rights than wrongs about it. The Electoral College is in the Constitution for an enormous reason; it is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of qualified citizens. This process allows for the people of the nation to have a say and for the elected people of each state to speak even louder for their state. The Electoral College is despised, yet it is the smartest way on how to elect the President.

The Electoral College requires for a president to have trans-regional appeal. For example, Romney was a solid favorite in the South, but he cannot win with only the votes from the South because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. While Romney did not have to campaign much for the South, he had to campaign very heavily in the North to increase his chances of election in those states. This is an amazing result because the people want a president that is liked throughout the nation, so while he is president he can be a hugely successful one. Canidates mainly focus on swing states, and dont have a lot of time for states they know they are going to win or lose; however, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing they are the ones to decide the election. These voters in swing states are averagely the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College should be kept because it almost always goes in favor of the people. Even though in the 2000 election Al Gore got the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral votes, that has not happened since 1888! The party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Many people want to change the election for the President to popular vote, but it would be more likely to have a dispute over the popular vote than in the elctoral college. Also, there could be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the total number of votes is an even number, but it is tremendously unlikely given that there has never been a tie. Also, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the voter's cast.

The Electoral College can be argued to repel potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state, for example, republicans in California; on the other hand, every voter's vote plays a big part to their state's electoral vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The Electoral College has worked for more than a century and will keep on working if the people of the nation agree to work with it.                    ",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"Although numerous amounts of people want to banish the Electoral College, there are more rights than wrongs about it.

If people limit car usage there will be less air pollution. Because cars use a nonreusable gas, Gasoline and diesel they must be burned in order for the cars engine to power the car. After it burns and gets used up the exhaust pipe from the car leaks out the Carbon Monoxide that resides in the car after the gas is burned. When realised into the atmosphere, the gas damages it. Not allowing enough sun to get in, creating smog which is harmful for the human to breathe, and blocks vision for many people! SO if we stop using cars or at least limit them, then we won't have these problems that often or even AT ALL! If there were half the amount of cars driving around everyday then we would have a much more beautiful sky than we do now, also we would not have as much fog as some people do. Like Paris. They banned driving for a few days because of smog! ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" Duffer Paragraph 1. So if we limit car usage we wouldn't have this problem!

If we limit or eliminate car usage in a certain area for a certain time, then people can go outside, enjoy the scenery and get some fresh air.

People with cars just drive past everything and don't really look around, but people who don't have cars enjoy the scenery, get fresh air, and get excessive.

626DA66E75D9,"Creativity of the mind is brewed from life experiences and knowledge. In some schools summer projects are assigned to students for various academic or elective based classes, these projects should be soley designed by the students and not by the teacher. Teacher-designed projects can lead to an interference with a students out of school life, be restrictive, and result in a higher lack of motivation.

Summer projects have a negatively connotated aspect attached to them that has continued on for many generations and people. Most students and classmates dread to hear the words ""summer project"" mostly due to the fact that it takes time away in which they could have been using to initiate in other things to benefit their lives or even just enjoy themselves. As it is, teachers lack a general scope of what a typical student can accomplish within their summer, as everyone pertains to their own activities during that time. Having the project written and designed by a number of students, or even just by themselves,would give a better outlook on the reasonable things to be accomplished where a teacher only expresses expectations which sometimes cannot be met. It is easy to set unreasonable expectations when the person setting them themself is not attuned to do it. Having the project designed by students could lead to much more accomplishment than expected as well. It is easy to assume students would try to make the project easier on themselves but just because the project is student designed doesn't mean it couldn't be regulated or have certain requirements given to them by others.

Each student is unique with different qualities and strengths. By making a teacher design the project it ultimatley takes away from a students expression and creativity because of the specific standards given to them. Expression is an important quality when it comes to projects. Not only does it make a student think more, but it also enhances their learning because they can express their ideas in different forms. It gives them more room to come up with their own ideas. A student-designed summer project would give the students a vast possibility to individually express themselves. When a teacher becomes the sole leader of making a project each project turned in by the class is the same but with different aspects, like color for example, and don't require the student to be creative. This in turn could eventually dull their levels of creativity and expression that could have benefitted them highly in their lives later on. Overall, a student-designed project could positively enhance the students and their educations more than that of which a teacher designed in all entirety. Projects are given to a student over the summer to retain knowledge and learn, if a teacher then leaves them no room to grow then the whole project defeats its own purpose altogether.

Many students lack motivation. Whether it involves school or simple activities outside of school, most students find themselves procrastinating or not doing what they set out to do at all. This is made evident by the amount of students who do not do their homework or even classwork and is a stunningly large amount no matter the school spectated and monitored. Students already deal with piles of homework or even other work given to them outside of school by their family, friends, or even job. Giving another assignment to a student, over the summer at that, will likely not be completed. By letting a student design their own summer project, not only does it increase the productivity of the project, but it aslo motivates them to complete it, or at the very least put some work into it. When a student designs a project, they base it mainly on what they would find interesting to work on rather than when a teacher assigns them something they tend to have no interest in at all. In comparison, if a person were to get a job and dread going to work everyday, it is likely that they would eventually quit; whereas, if a person finds their job interesting or enjoyable they are more likely to continue and pursue that job. The same could be said for a summer project. Teachers focus specificly on getting academic topics as the main focus rather than if it would actually be entertaining or fun for a student to do and take part in. I believe this says a lot about why students should be the ones to design it for themselves.

Altogether, the preference between teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects weighs heavily towards the students. Giving a student the opportunity to enjoy their break from school, letting them express themselves, and giving them something they actually find interesting is an important part of summer projects most do not consider.

I belive that we should change the election to a popular vote for the president of the united states. We should have this for two reasons, one we should make the choice ourselfs so it matters more in the long run and two it will make more potental voters. We as americans should have more power when it comes to chooseing our president.

Some people may argue that the electorial college avoids the problem of run-off elections as stated in source two. I think if there is a tie then there should have the previouse presedent of the united states vote to brek the tie. I dont believe any vote should count more than a citizens vote. If we are suppose to have a goverment run by the people why cant the peoples vote matter.

I feel that people would vote more if their vote could be that single vote that decides who`s president. In the electorial college only their vote matters the popular vote doesn`t make a difference in the long run. The reason people vote is so that the person they want as president will win the race not so the person the electorial college wants to will win. The popular vote is simply deciding electors who can vote however they please which means the citizens vote doesnt make a difference wich unfair.

6BFE57AA416B,"In the summer, student's minds are in the clouds, and they often forget that they have a summer school project to work on. Of course, this is always a bummer to have, and when students have to start on a project that the teacher has designed for them, it's even worse. Students are more likely to procrastinate, work on the project last minute, and have the mindset of thinking that the project that they have to work on is dumb. The lack of motivation and creativity will end up of making the project not as bright, and rather dull looking, as they struggle working on the project in the summer. However, if a student is able to design their own project, they would be able to put more effort into completing the project and be more creative on how they will complete the project. A student should be able to design their own project, because it helps them feel more motivated, be more creative, and they can take the information that they are using from the project and actually learn from it.

As a student myself, I tend to put more effort into my work when I know I can have fun with it. Instead of working on summer project that is picked by a teacher, the idea of picking my own project-design seems more motivating and more enjoyable to work on. When students have the option to work on a project that they can choose from, they end up forgetting that they are working on a project. Instead, they are just having fun and thinking that they are just working on a new summer hobby. The more people that enjoy on what their project is going to be, they are more likely to complete the project faster and not procrastinate on the project. This makes students gain better work ethic and not be lazy when completing a project they know that they don't have motivation for.

A student-designed project either allows students to become more creative or have students show off their creativity skills. Rather than just meeting the requirements that the teacher has given them, a student can go above and beyond on a project when they choose their own project. If the school gives students their own way to create their summer project, it can show teachers how they work when they present them when the students go back to school. Allowing students to show off their skills can show both students and teachers what that student can do, and he/she can inspire other students to become more creative when there is another project that is assigned to them.

The whole point of summer projects is for that students can make sure that they are still learning during their break. If they have to work on a project that is designed by a teacher, how would they ever feel motivated to actually learn from the project that they have to do? If a student gets to design their own project, they can pick their own project that it is interesting to them, and take their time to actually learn from it. Myself for example, I learn better when I have more fun, and when I find ways to make it more enjoyable.

Although if a teacher-designed project would be assigned to students, it would be easier for teachers to grade, as they already understand the topic(s) that is chosen for them. However, students would barely learn anything about the topic that is chosen for them, because they are forced to work on that topic. Also when the students are back in school and they have to present their projects, the other students might not even pay attention to their classmates presenting, because they would already know the information that is going to be said. The classmates that I've talk to in my school state to my that they have more fun with a project when they get to pick their own topic to choose from, and tend to pay attention more to when their classmates present different projects topics.

As it for being summertime when students have to work on their projects, it should be fun for them, as summertime is supposed to be time for students to have a break from school. That means not only they should enjoy their time tanning by the pool, vacationing, or even hanging out with their friends and family, they should work on a project that really speaks out to them, so that they can feel motivated to work on the project. If a project is assigned to students in the summer, it should be a student-designed project, so that it is more enjoyable/motivational, creative, and beneficial when helping them learn.

1A3CF2F34B5B,"Dear Principal,

You asked for student's opinions on the subject of the new school rule that concerns whether students should be able to participate in after-school activities or sports if they have a C or lower average. I do think this is a good idea. This new rule can be a motivation for students who slack off in school, and now they can have a reason to work harder.

A grade of a C is a passing grade, so students think it's all right to not work any harder because they're already passing. However, a C is not what students should strive for. Taking away privileges, such as after-school activities or sports, is an excellent way to make students work harder to get a B. However, I do think you should either allow them to go to study sessions or start study groups to help them achieve and maintain a B or an A.

In addition, this would help our whole school learn things faster, because students will have to work to receive maintain a B or an A, unlike when they had a C. Although this might cause the sports teams or school clubs to lose members, I think it is worth it. I believe that students should be more concerned about their grades than their clubs or sports. I also think that parents would be more proud of their children for trying harder in school because of the motivation.

Also, teachers would be happier with the students because they are working harder. If the students pay more attention in class and do their homework, and stay after for extra help, the teachers will be happier and more encouraging because the students are trying hard. Furthermore, the students with a C average will learn that they have to work hard to achieve a goal, and that maintaining a B or an A average takes work and determination.

I believe this new school policy of ""Having a B average will allow you to participate in after-school activities and sports"" is a great one. I think it will help students work harder, teachers being more encouraging, and overall help our school.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" reported Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two.

With the absence of traffic jams stress can most definitely be altered to a place of no stress and carfree day can leave the streets devoid of traffic jams, according to Andrew Selsky. Stress can drive someone crazy and it's in everyone's best interest that we, as residents of the world, try and stop the things that can cause stress. Some may argue that not having a car is stressful, but having stress over the presence of traffic jams can over see any other kind of stress to be thought of.

Are you tired of not being able to see bevause of smog and having bad particles in the air? Limitation can take away these issues! Paris can definitely be one to complain because in Robert Duffer's article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" they had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter a little over Brussels counts and almost twice as the amount in Londons.

Carlos Arturo Plaza gives his opinion by commenting ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Limitating how much you use your car can greatly help places around the world and help your own body.

Almost 4,000 drivers were fined because they chose to invalidate the regulation of not using their car according to Robert Duffer. Is it worth paying the prices?

Having to be forced to and extra school activity should not be permitted because students have things after school, Also they are already at school for 7 or 8 hours and need a break, and adding to that students just need a break. The brain works better on a clear mind and having an after school activity can lessen that.",20.766366958618164,21.127368927001953,21.127368927001953
2DEC8D3BA891,"Dear principal,

It has come to attention that you are considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sport of other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Of course, many students have a C average. It is my opinion that students should be allowed to play sports even thought they have a C average. I have many reasons for this, extra curricular activities are to be enjoyed and anyone should participate in them, It is also a better alternative than the students forming gangs and being out in the streets. Lastly, It would benefit everyone if kids with C averages could play sports because it keeps them fit. It would truly be appreciated by the whole student body if you would not change the school policy and allow everyone to participate in sports and other activities.

Foremost, kids with C averages should be able to play sports because sports should be enjoyed and cherished by everyone. Don't you remember your first baseball game? the smell of hotdogs and the impressive sight of that enormous diamond, the vendors yelling out ""Get your popcorn! 5 bucks a bag!"" and the overexcited fans. Imagine actually playing the game, especially if you love the sport, amazing right? then why should it be taken away from you just because you have a C average in school? That isn't fair at all! If it's something you love, you shouldn't be stopped from playing it, whether it's soccer or football, basketball or volleyball, all sports should be equally enjoyed by all sports fans. What about the people in clubs? most of the time it's where you can express your creativity outside of home and where you can discover new passions for things.

Furthermore, having students join clubs and sports is better than having them form gangs and patrolling the cities. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather have the students participating in school related activities than out in the streets. If you won't allow the C and below averaged students participate, then who knows what'll happen to their futures.

Last but not least, i understand that by keeping them out of the students out of these activities might help them improve their grades but in fact, you are preventing them from keeping themselves healthy and fit. When students participate in sports and extra curricular activities their minds are constantly working, and so are their bodies keeping them both physically and mentally well. It's a true fact proven by scientist in Arizona that 80% of students participating in sports can prevent obesity and heart disease.

To sum it all up, I think that it will benefit everyone if you allow students to play sports with

C averages. Extra curricular activities are to be enjoyed and anyone should participate in them, It is also a better alternative than the students forming gangs and being out in the streets. Lastly, It would benefit everyone if kids with C averages could play sports because it keeps them fit.

Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral yotes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't yoting for a President but we're yoting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just yoting for those electors, we are yoting for the whole idea behind their campaigning. We don't yote for the person, we yote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By haying this process, we can focus on getting swing states yotes. The yotes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in "" In Defense of the Electoral College: Fiye reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President "", ""swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election."" This helps ayoid runon elections because the small states are likey to just yote for the most popular President, knowing their yote won't really make a difference.

Most states haye a ""winnertakeall"" system that giyes all of the electors to the winning candidate. Howeyer, there are a few states that haye yariation with the ""proportional representation"" idea. The ""winnertakeall"" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to giye all of the yotes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process y. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidential process one step easier.

And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article "" What Is the Electoral College?

7F697EF803C9,"Some schools today require projects over the summer break to ensure they still remember about the subjects they were taught the previous semester. But should these projects be designed by the student to make the project more enjoyable? Or should they be teacher designed to make sure they meet the criteria needed? Well, students should be given a break during the summer because that is what is is all about and it is a time to relax and enjoy the weather. So I would have to say that students, if required to do the project, should design the summer project. here is why I believe that they should.

Students will be more interested to the project if they got to assign it, because the average student today will most likely forget or just rather enjoy their break. If they were able to design it the way they want to, then they can enjoy project a lot more. There will be some students that still won't do the project, but they were not going to do the project either way weather the student nor' teacher designed the project. But if the student designed the project, then a higher percentage of students will actually do it.

Student designing the project can be a benefit of there own. How can it be a benefit? Well, when the students come together they can explore each others ideas and thoughts about a subject. They can listen to each other and it can be a great way to build on their listing and social skills with the added fact that the can come up with new and brilliant ideas that can be more relevant and unique than a single teacher. Students can also learn more about each other with this exercise and become relatively close with one another.

In lower grade levels such as, second grade to seventh grade, most just get their parents do it. I know about this occurring because in my fourth grade year there were about 32 kids in my classroom, and every project that was assigned to us, every kid had their parents do the project for them. So, kids today havent changed and the project will be irrelevant to them. But if the students make one, then this could limit the project strictly to the student in a way that the parent could not understand the project, therefore unable to do the project for them.

In conclusion, weather the students designed the project or the teacher. Students can have many more benefits than a teacher would. From having a more enjoyable time, to being more effective to the students education. Parents would have to be involved and the student can learn new things without even knowing about it.

I hope this brought a new light to the subject and to influence you to see both sides of the argument.

Some of the reasons to join the seagoing cowboys is that they get to see tons of awesome landmarks. If you love horses and cattle then is most likely the job for you. You get to enteract with them and feed them care for them like they were your own. Even if you just want to help out your world out then this could be the job for you.

It's amazing how much stuff you can do there to when the jobs done you might be able to look at the pretty things there. Sometimes if your lucky you have to go right through town so you get to see the pretty things on the way there. When it's time to go back home you play games where the horses were cared for. If seagoing cowboys were still around I would love to be one so badly. It would be so cool if I could be one too.

In conclusion, all i'm saying is that the seagoing cowboys would be something worth doing and worth while. You can go so many places and you rarely go to the same place ever.

79924dfe,"Dear our state Senator, I am writing to you for not only myself but for the citizens of our state. I do not agree with The Electoral College and I think that our way of voting for president should be based off of popular vote. I know our state and our country has been using electoral college as our way of voting for a very long time throughout our nations history. But Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. and i'll tell you whats wrong with the electoral college.

As you may know we do not directly vote for our president. we vote for our electors who will hopefully vote for the president we want. when the time comes for voting the state legislature are technically responsible for picking our electors. We the people are not always in control of who they vote for and the electors could always defy our will. We do not always control who they vote for. So is it really fair if we vote for an elector who doesnt even support us and our say in who we want to lead our country?

Another reason why i do not agree with the electoral college is for the smaller states. they do not have as much of a say in who runs our country like we do. luckily we are one of the biggest states along with california. but in smaller states they almost have no say at all. they dont even see campaigns because no one running for office pays attention to the smaller states. For instance, The campaign in 2000 seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.

One of the biggest faults in the electoral college even though it is very unlikely but not impossible is a tie. As you already know if there was a tie the election would be thrown to the house of representatives,where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the houses selections would hardly even show the will of the people. the people would barely have any say whatsoever. does that seem fair to you?

Those are the reasons why i and many other citizens do not agree with the electoral college. its unfair to us , the people, and smaller states. America is known for being the country of freedom and choice, but if we the people barely have say in who runs our country, are we really eligible to be called that? thats why i think we should use popular vote as our way of electing our president.",,0,0.0,"Dear our state Senator, I am writing to you for not only myself but for the citizens of our state.

A3E684CC43AD,"I think that in our constantly changing society that technology has become apart of our everyday lives. Almost everywhere you go you will see some sort of smart device whether that being a smart phone, a smart watch, or a smart doorbell. Technology has changed and grown significantly over the last couple of years, but school is the same as it was a hundred years ago. Students are still mindlessly sitting in chairs for hours listening to lectures about things they don't understand or care about. Technology is in almost every aspect of our lives; our homes, our cars, our doorbells, and even in our fridges, so why not use it in education. I think that students should have a say in the way they are taught so if students want to attend class from home and are willing to do the work why not. I think that students should be able to attend classes from home because they would be able to learn more and get a personalized education and they would have more free time to just be kids.

I think that a lot of students in schools aren't learning anything because one they can't learn in the environment that they are in and two they don't learn the way the teacher teaches. If a teacher has about 150 students they will probably teach to each of those students the same lesson the same way. Half of those students probably didn't understand the lesson the teacher just taught maybe because the teacher taught it to fast or maybe because she explained it in a way that didn't make sense to the student. If you have a teacher who's teaching style doesn't relate to the way you learn what do you do? You ask for help, but some students are afraid to. If student were able to work at home they could talk to the teacher one on one and ask for help without being afraid and the teacher could learn about how that student learns best and possibly teach them better.

There are 24 hours in a day. From nine in the morning to four in the afternoon students are at school, that leaves 17 hours in which it is recommended that students get eight hours of sleep. That leaves nine hours not including the commute to and from school and the time you get up so you can eat breakfast, get dressed, and all the other things you need to do before you leave the house. So lets say students have about seven hours of free time to do with what they will, but now imagine if they could go to class from home. They wouldn't have to worry about traveling or getting up super early to make it to school on time. They could just wake up and open their laptops ready to do their school work that would give maybe nine hours of free time if not more. In that time they could do so much not just learn more but just have the time to relax and do what they want to do. I don't think students get enough time to just relax and chill out with there busy schedules, so I think that having school at home would give students an opportunity they never had before that would benefit everyone.

Some people say that if we let students attend class form home students wouldn't get their assignments done and would take advantage of this opportunity and do things they shouldn't. Yes I do think this would happen if there aren't rules in place so that if that does happen the people that didn't do the work will be punished not everyone by taking away an opportunity. There are always people who will take advantage of the system that is there to help people but don't let them ruin it for everyone.

I think that this would be a great opportunity for a lot of students and would change the classroom experience. Although some people say that if students attended classes from home they wouldn't do their work and wouldn't learn anything. I think that students would benefit from attending classes from home because they could learn more and have a personalized education and would have more free time.

465810444E5F,"Dear Principal,

Due to the fact that we live in America, where we have the choice of choosing what we would like to do, (most of the time), I due believe that students should have the right to choose weather or not they want to participate in community service. I do, however, want to sate the fact that if we do choose to do community service that our world would be a much better place. I don't, however, believe in forcing people to do something they don't have to do.

On the other hand. if we do community service, we would get jobs done much faster. For example, lets say we helped out at the pound and the it was overflowing with dogs. If we helped out the people, it wouldn't only be a nice thing to do, but you could get some benefits as well. Maybe they'd offer you a job or you may just feel good about helping your fellow community members.

Another example is cleaning up trash on the highway, or anywhere really. That trash will add up and become a huge heap of trash. It's not healthy for you. the plants, or the animals. just imagine what could happen if a small animal ate something that was toxic to them. That wouldn't be good at all.

So just keep in mind that community service is a great thing to do, but if some people don't want to, you shouldn't force them.

The electoral college is also flawed in a way that it makes the smaller states feel less important than the bigger states.

What if say, 5,000 people vote in Florida, 3,000 for president 1, and 2,000 for president 2, and the electoral college sends it off as president 1 gets the vote for that college. But then, that 1,000 vote difference could have changed the vote for president country wide. A scenario like this may be unlikely, but it is possible.

If we keep this up, the  first the sky will turn black and then it will fall and world will end! Hopefully nobody wants the world to end because of smog. To reduce the amount of smog and pollution caused by cars we can all reduce the usege of our cars. Therfore, the limiting of cars can significantly reduce pollution.

77316C69A5BD,"Today was a long day at school wasn't it? You did a lot of work. Studied hard. Maybe you even spent two blocks typing an essay for your SOL. Wouldn't it be nice to take a break and do something you enjoy? I think all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

To start, activities can help kids make new friends and socialize. An article published by NOVA stated that ""87% of students that participate in after school activities make a friend that they previously weren't friends with."" That's a large number. Based on the study, students make friends more frequently when they are in the same club or activity as someone with the same interest as you. I think that making new friends and having fun in an activity is something everyone should experience. In the same article, it states that ""kids that share the same interest tend to develop a stronger friendship than kids with opposite interest and personalities."" The easiest way to find someone that shares interest with you is to go to a club or activity. You'll meet people with the same liking as you. I actually met my best friend at a extracurricular activity. We were both in the same club, meaning we share somewhat of the same interest, so we started talking more, and we became best friends.

Another reason is, kids can take a break from school and relax for a while. A study done by the Virginia Health Department shows that ""the average kids aged 11 and older that play a sport or do an activity they love, have their stress level decreased by up to 67%. It can also help clear their mind from all the bad and corruption going on around them."" When I play basketball, everything that I'm thinking about clears and I stay focused on the game. At that point, I know longer feel stressed or worried about anything going on around me. I think that's always a good thing to do. Just have fun and relax. Don't be stressed or worried about anything. Just enjoy yourself. Another article by Richard Sampson, writer for the Washington Post, stated that ""playing a sport or participating in an activity showed to be just as effective, if not more effective than meditation. It clears and calms the brain and body while having fun and enjoying oneself."" Having fun, and being stress free? That sounds like a win-win situation to me. I think it's a great thing to do. You lose stress and have fun. Why wouldn't you want to do an extracurricular activity?

On the other hand, students shouldn't be forced to do an extracurricular activity if the don't want to. A study done by the Loudoun County Public Activities Club (LCPAC) showed that students that were forced to sign up for and activity didn't have fun or enjoy them self.

If they don't like the activity they signed up for, then they don't have to do it next time. Try something else. Activities are supposed to be a fun, enjoyable time.

To bring it all together, extracurricular activities should be something all students do. It brings fun, joy, new friends, and takes away stress and anxiety.

Driverless cars are wrong beacuse they could cause a lot more accidents from technology malfunctions, they could potentially cause many law suits and problems in our world, and they will make humans even more technology dependent and incapable of taking care of themselves if somehow we lost all electricity and had to operate cars by ourselves.

Driverless cars are owned and operated by the company who makes them, humans have little to no control on what happens in the car. So if the car crashes, would it be the manufacturers fault or the humans fault? Driverless cars could potentially cause many unneccesary arguments and law suits between manufacturers and consumers. If someone is riding in the driverless car, and the car crashes, the manufacturers should be the ones to blame unless they develop a technology to enable the humans to take complete control if neccesary. Many arguments could be made that the manufacturer didn't program the car correctly anf that is why the person was injured or even so much as killed. This could result in manufacturers of big companies paying millions maybe even billions of dollars in law suits.

Driverless cars could cause a lot more accidents because there isn't someone physically watching the surroundings of the car, and technology as simple as calculators can malfunction sometimes, so would you really trust a car run by a computer with your life? Driverless cars have no human physically driving unless it enables the human to drive, and even then it will be hard to avoid the accident because the car wouldn't inform the human about the incident unles just milliseconds before it happens because they can't predict the future and neither can we. The amount of accidents would most likely skyrocket if driverless cars became an everyday thing because of the lack of control and responsibilty a human has in the car.

Today we have many different things that involve technology. We have phones that we depend on for almost everything we do in life, we have computers which we use to store information, we have calculators so we don't even have to remember how to do simple math on our own. Almost everything we do in life has some sort of technology to make our lives easier. Now we might not even have to drive our own car. Driverless cars could mean that people never have to learn how to drive, and then what would happen if for some reason the world lost all electricity, wifi, and communication signals? That means no more phones computers, calculators, and no driverless cars. People are so dependent on technology today that giving them another thing to be dependent on to not have to drive themselves is going to cause a lot of problems if the world has an extreme crisis. Hardly anyone would know how to drive, which means very little transportation and it will be ahrder to communicate with people.

Driverless cars should be illegal because it could potentially cause ven more uneeded law suits and arguments, it could cause a lot more deaths in car accidents, and it would make people very uneducated on how to get places if the technology somehow stopped working. The world is just fine driving themselves, and on top of everything else we depend on technology for, it would be nice to keep at least one thing we have to do for ourselves just for the sake of human independency.

Driverless cars have no human physically driving unless it enables the human to drive, and even then it will be hard to avoid the accident because the car wouldn't inform the human about the incident unles just milliseconds before it happens because they can't predict the future and neither can we. The amount of accidents would most likely skyrocket if driverless cars became an everyday thing because of the lack of control and responsibilty a human has in the car. Today we have many different things that involve technology. We have phones that we depend on for almost everything we do in life, we have computers which we use to store information, we have calculators so we don't even have to remember how to do simple math on our own. Almost everything we do in life has some sort of technology to make our lives easier. Now we might not even have to drive our own car. Driverless cars could mean that people never have to learn how to drive, and then what would happen if for some reason the world lost all electricity, wifi, and communication signals? That means no more phones computers, calculators, and no driverless cars. People are so dependent on technology today that giving them another thing to be dependent on to not have to drive themselves is going to cause a lot of problems if the world has an extreme crisis. Hardly anyone would know how to drive, which means very little transportation and it will be ahrder to communicate with people. Driverless cars should be illegal because it could potentially cause ven more uneeded law suits and arguments, it could cause a lot more deaths in car accidents, and it would make people very uneducated on how to get places if the technology somehow stopped working. The world is just fine driving themselves, and on top of everything else we depend on technology for, it would be nice to keep at least one thing we have to do for ourselves just for the sake of human independency. If we create driverless cars, we will truly not have anything left to do for ourselves and there will be extreme crisises if something were to happen to our electricity.",24.515901565551758,24.012741088867188,24.012741088867188
06DAD53DA2B9,"Do you like to go home and sleep, play video games, watch television, or even play with friends? Well now you... cannot. The principal of your school has decided to make extracurricular activities mandatory. Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory because, students need, family time, rest time, and play time.

Students need to have time with their families. If students do not get family time, then they could become mentally sick and incapable of certain tasks and activities. There are also many benefits of family time. Some of those benefits are: better relationships with others in the family, improved behavior, and all-in-all improved mental health.

The average child needs 8-9 hours of sleep each night. Many children already do not achieve this amount of sleep because of school. If the Principal makes extracurricular activities mandatory, then most students will have to sacrifice play time and possibly even family time. The performance of students on tests and other class work will start to go down. It will affect the school as a whole if the students are over-tired and slow.

Normally, students are able to hang out with friends, play video games, watch TV, and other activities that the students enjoy. Studies have shown that a little bit of play time or video games each day helps kids to focus. The students could then use that focus to do better in school. If students are being forced to participate in extracurricular activities, they will most likely just lose focus and do worse in school.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities should not be mandatory, students need, family time, rest time, and play time.

Fifty out of one hundred students play sports and out of the fifty only twenty of them have good grades. This is a good punishment because playing sports is the least of your problems. The only thing that you should be worried about is what your going to do when you grow up.

Finally you should not be able to play sports if you don't have accurate grades because what happens when you don't have a job are you just going to play baseball in the backyard?

E24F801F1C4A,"Advice is something many people would like to have when making a hard decision. So many people struggle with having to make such a diffcult choice. This can affect your daily actives and interfer with school, school is already so stressful and adding more stress is just so overwhelming. Having others advice can help with the stress and the amount of time it takes. This is why asking for help can never hurt because it can influence you to make an outstanding decision that you would have never done before, but before you make the final descion you have to go through the steps to make a perfect one. Before doing that you have to think about why other peoples advice can help. Doing this means you will not be so stressed when asking for advice. The main things asking for help can do are relive the ongoing stress, help you focus on the conquences of others opinions, and you can make the decision faster.

First it will help you relive the ongoing stress. Many people struggle with horrible stress and it can be really hard. Having all this weight on your shoulders can bring you down. You can go into a bad mind set and want to give up. It can be very diffcult to relive your stress sometimes. Asking for other peoples opinions when making a decision, can help you. It will make it easier for you because you have friends to be there for you during the stressful times. When I make a hard decision I like to take care of myself. Giving yourself love and care can relive stress too, during hard times. You do not want to have your stress get in the way of your school, or sports. Stress can make you forget about what is important and make you just focus on that one thing. That is why when you ask for help it can also, help relive your stress.

Next, it will make you focus on the conquences of each opinion. The first step to make a good decision is to think about your conquences. Some people make a decision and regret it because they did not think about their conquences. For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you. Having the help of others advice, can lead you into making the right decision.

Lastly, it will help you make the decision faster. If you ask for help, you might not have so much stress, therefore you might make the decision faster. Making it faster will mean you will have less stress, you wont have to worry about it so much, and you can just move on and enjoy it. When something goes by faster you can just think about the furture and not worry so much on the present. You can make other decisions too, do fun stuff with friends, instead of thinking and worrying about one thing. School might be less stressful because you will not be carring so much weight on your shoulders and you will focus more. Everyone already knows school is so stressful, so making one little thing less stressful can help you focus a lot more. This will make your teachers very proud because they will see you focus more on your work and not be so worked up. You might even do better on test and your grades will be better because you are actually focused instead of worrying about everything.

In conculsion, getting advice from other people is a huge benefit to have. You will have way less stress then just having no help and influence, then you did before. Also you will be way more focused at school because you are not so worried about one decision.

D80B98C274D4,"Extending each school day

I totally disagree with extending each school day, because kids wouldn't have enough time do other activities, kids need a distracion away from school, they need to put their minds in something other than just school. Kids, parents, and teacher have other things to do, they all have plans and will get in the way of that.

One of the reasons why i disagree with extanding the school day is that kids will not have enough time to do other activities, for example after school programs, clubs, and practice. If the school board adds another hour kids will get so caught up on homework that will not have enough time to other activities

Kids need a distraction from school, although school is really important, kids needs to distract their minds away from everything in school, like test, wetheater or not they failing, drama, all the stress schools brings sometimes. They just a rest from everything, they need a ""stress free"" time. Kids needs time for themselfs, time to do something that's not always school.

Kids, parents, and teachers do other acitivites after school, for example kids go to football practice right after school or pian lessons, they might not be able to go. They can have doctors appointment,

since some kids get appointments late in day so they won't miss a day in school. Parents needs to go places with their kids at a specifc time, and if they come late and kids will be too tired to go with them. Teachers got palns, they need to do stuff after school, maybe their kids has a game, or they need to go to their kids rehersal and if school board extends a day, teacher would not be able to go because they are working, maybe some teachers studies after work, or they do homework if they in collage. Adding one more hour to school can ruin everyone's schudule.

In conclusion extending each school day can be a big change with time for everyone. Kids needs time for themself, they need distraction away from school and the time it's left for them to have a free time it might be nothing since they will be in school and then do homwork.

Scientist say a place in Idaho that is called Middle Butte looks very similar to the Face. The pictures the very nice camera took of the Face is proof that they do look alike and that it is just a natural artifact.

The pollution of the air is a major argument for people who support the nonusage of cars or other motorized vehicles.

Road rage also causes more accidents which causes more deaths. Making driving, a dangerous thing. Although, citizens still drive motorized vehicles.

6762fd3a,"Dear, Senator I think the president should be elected by popular vote not electors. Heres some reasons why i think the president should be voted by popular vote and not electors.

One reason is when you vote for your president your actually voting for the presidents elector. So basically your not voting fot a president your voting for a elector that votes for you. After the election the government prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" a certificate of ascertainment is a listing of all the candidates who ran for president along with the names of there electors. The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning president and which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the elector in december of election year.

Another reason is more people would rather abolish electoral college. Electoral college is dumb because there was a gallop poll in 2000 taken shortly afte Al Gore. In the poll Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency because of the electoral college. In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, Bush received 271 electoral votes and Gore received 266. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for slate electors. Who can be electors? It can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes state partys central committee, and sometimes the presidential candidates.

Last but not least the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationnists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their partys candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please. What happens if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponents electors. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote in that case the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vicepresident. Each state only casts one vote that means the single representatives from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have as much say as California who represents 35 million voters. An electoral tie seems unlikely think of this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election In 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

What im trying to say is the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all including Rhode island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaigh ad.

People work better in an environment they are most comfortable in, which would be their home. Students would benefit from taking classes from home by being in the comfort of their home, not having to find transportation, nor having to interact with people in person if they're shy or antisocial.

Being in the comfort of their home can benefit students when working. If Generic_Name was in a school where he got bullied and picked on for his extremely small size then he would not want to be there but rather, somewhere where he feels safe and comfortable. When Generic_Name tries to do his work, all he would think about is what the other kids are saying about him or what they'll make fun of him for during lunch. When Generic_Name goes to school and has to sit in a chair all day in class, he obtains back problems. If he were at home he could sit on his bed and move around to stretch out his body to stay loose therefore, making his back not get any aches. Students being able to work in a place they're most comfortable could make them more productive.

Not having to find transportation to school would make things tremendously easier on students. Generic_Name's parents both work away from home for the Government in Generic_City. and her house is in Generic_City while her school is in Generic_City, 30 minutes away, so there isn't a bus that comes to get her therefore, she either doesn't go to school or takes an Uber, when her parents can pay for one. If Generic_Name could take school from home then she wouldn't have to miss so many days and her parents wouldn't have to pay for Ubers most of the days. Generic_Name lives 1 mile away from her bus stop, that she's supposed to walk to every morning but, she doesn't want to walk alone in the dark and her parents can't walk her because they have to work so, they try to get family members to drive her to school but most of the time they're busy. If Generic_Name was able to take her classes from home then she would'nt have to worry about walking in the dark in the mornings, where she feels scared but instead, she would'nt have to leave her house for school. Students being allowed to do school from home, would'nt have to find transportation, when they don't have it.

Students who are antisocial and don't want to interact with people, would'nt have to, if they took school at home. Generic_Name doesn't like to talk to people in person because he gets nervous and then blacks out, like when Generic_Name asked for his number during lunch break at school and then he fainted in the middle of the Cafe. If Generic_Name could take school at home then he would'nt have any problems with getting nervous then blacking out or fainting. Generic_Name doesn't talk to anyone because she gets very awkward around any new person she meets and embarrasses her self, like when Generic_Name asked what her name was in Science class and then she farted on him and fell out of her chair and onto the floor. If Generic_Name could take school from home then she would'nt have to socialize with any new people and embarrass her self. Antisocial students being able to take school from home would allow them to only have to interact with their family, that they already know, and no one new to them.

By being in the comfort of their home, not having to find transportation, nor having to socialize with people in person, when they dont want to, students would benefit from taking their school classes from home. Students can be more productive in the comfort of their home rather than in a public place, like school.

But when asking advice from other people, don't do just one and have an isolated one-sided opinion, instead, ask more than one person to get a more accurate choice on specific subjects.

If you're a nervous kind of person who doesn't have the courage to talk to others, practice talking often to improve yourself so you can ask anything, anytime, without going through an emotional breakdown. And plus, even if you ask one or two people, you still could have a slightly biased opinion. That's why you should ask about 5 to 7 people on the subject of choice to get a true non biased, open, honest opinion. Also, certain subjects require more or less people. Asking if you can eat something could just require only 1 to 3 people.

Even asking a lot of people on subjects count as big social interaction which is a great way to get into a job, or even start a business! Jobs especially, requires being socialite to even have a chance in getting the position of the job of your choice. But it all starts with asking before taking action. But it is most best to seek out many different opinions to get your own. for example, video game designers have to ask probably thousands of people before even getting close to releasing your games.

Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life.

Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she don't like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.

Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didn't pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesn't mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life.

Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure.

D628429A0645,"Dear Sir or Madam:

I think the new policy regarding that students can't participate in sports if they have a C average. First, I believe that this is not fair because of struggles. For example, If they are struggling in a class it is not their fault they are trying to the best of their abilities.

I also believe that this new policy is wrong because they can still pass with a C. For example, if they are not failing I don't think that this policy is fair because a test they didn't do well on might have brought their grade.

Furthermore, I think if we should make a policy similar to yours, but a little more flexible. For example, If they have one E I think that is more justice then a B average.

Another reason that l think this policy shouldn't be passed with the requirements of having a B average to participate in any activities; therefore, if students have a C or D grade they shouldn't have to give up their way to represent our school.

To conclude, I think that the new policy shouldn't be passed because the students struggle time to time.

Also if this was true, NASA wouldn't hide this because if they were to discover ancient civilization they would earn alot of money.

To start off there are different looking landforms on are planet why can't there be others. In the first set of pictures it shows the landform changed,so a face wasn't there to begin with,it was forming over time. Also sometimes when the human mind is told something it would try to shape together to form what was said, so this could be just a natural landform and your mind is changing it.

Also NASA would not keep this a secret if alien activity was found in this area,if anything NASA would make alot of money off of this discovery if it did have to do with aliens. But if NASA wanted to keep it a secret they wouldnt have took a picture and let the media get ahold of it they would have kept the pictures stashed away.

6204A1726C16,"Schools are known to be one of the struggles that all student go through. Because many students struggle with school, online classes and studying from home became an option. However, attending classes in school is more beneficial than taking classes at home, because students focus more in classes at school than at home, and because school is a place where students meet new people and make friendships.

Although some might argue that schools make students stressed, however, schools provide entertaining trips for students, as mentioned before, schools is a place where students make friendships. A

trip with friends helps to overcome stress. Not to add, schools also offer lots of programs and counseling to help out stressed students to overcome their stress.

Taking classes at school helps students be more focused on the lesson that is being discussed in class. For example, when taking classes at home student will have the freedom to do other things while the lesson is being explained, such as using cell phones or talking to people in the same room. This leads to; students not having the full attention and focus on the lesson. This makes students not fully understanding of the lesson and causing them to get bad grades. Since all the attention will be on the lesson at classes in school, students will be focused and will have better grades. Additionally, taking classes at school also gives students the opportunity to ask questions in case of not understanding something, which online classes don't always provide for students.

School is the place where students make friendships and have fun. For instance, when taking classes at home, students will miss the chance to go school dances and make memories. Also, schools help with meeting new people, learning whats wrong and whats right by going through some trouble. This helps students figure out who they are, and who they want to be. When taking classes at home, it will lower the chance for students to meet new people and to figure out who they want to be. That is why classes at school are more helpful.

DD5516A5BDD5,"Do you ever wonder if asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice? I think asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice because they get multiple options to choose from. Another reason why I think asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice can be hard to get from only one person. Another reason why asking more than one person for advice can help someone make a better choice is because advice from more than one person gives you more advice to think about. Getting advice from more then one person is a better choice because you have multiple options, it can be hard to get from only one person, and it gives you more then one idea.

Asking more than one person for advice can help them make a better choice because they have multiple options to choose from. Having multiple options can help someone make a better choice because they might not agree with someone. It could also help someone because they could choose one that they like and dislike because they have multiple options to choose from. For example if I needed advice for high school and I ask multiple people, I could choose which advise I liked the most. Another example would be If I needed advice on how to get good grades at school and I ask multiple people if I don't agree on what someone else said I could agree with someone else and take their advice.

Advice can be hard to get from only one person because you need to get other people's advice on what you need advice on. Another reason why advice can be hard to get from one person is because you also need to get more than one persons opinion. For example if I ask my friend for advice and she gives advice and I don't like it, I would go to someone else because I didn't like the advice she gave to me. Another example would be if I ask someone for advice and they give it to me and I don't like it I would go to someone else. That is why it's important to get advice from more than one person because you might have not liked the advice someone gave to you so you go to another person.

Getting advice from more then one person gives you more advice ideas to think about. For example if I ask someone for advice and I ask someone else and they both give me great advice I can have two advice to think about. Another example would be I ask multiple people for advice and they give me advice and I like both of the advice multiple advice to think about. Getting more then one opinion can help someone make a better choice because they have more then one advice to think about and they can choose which advice they like the most. Getting advice give you more ideas to think about.

Advice can be hard to choose from, but asking multiple people can make it easy because you have different options to choose from. Sometimes when people give you advice you might not agree with them, but the more people you ask the more advice you get, and the more advice you can choose from. In my opinion asking more than one person for advice is a better choice because you get different answers from people.

Secondly it is difficult for teachers to please each kid individualy and work with each child 1 on 1 and with this technological advancment it will give teachers a break and require them to give minimal assistance to the kids. In this day and age technology is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our everyday soceity and less and less people are wanting to become teachers, so having a computer do the job for them and do it just as good is remarkable. The author wrote in paragraph 6 ""imagine a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" this quote from the article showing that they would do the teachers job and be able to adapt and please each student individualy.

Lastly having this technology in every school would increase learning rates greatly because it would work in a way to help and assure learning for each child individualy. The problem with teaching today is some kids dont learn as fast as other and the teacher doesnt slow down to make sure they know what they are doing, but with the FACS program it will allow kids to go at their own success rate and insure they are really learning.

992BADE2458A,"I am against the making of driverless cars. Us as human have been driving for quite a while now, and as they say ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Many people bring up the statistics of car crashes and deaths. What they do not see is that almost all of them are because the driver was impared. They could have been drinking, under the influence of a drug, texting, or distracted by some other object. There should not be driverless cars because it is too dangerous with the technology and hacking there is now, it will also cost millions or even billions of dollars,and in a dangerous situation nothing compares to the human mind.

Making these driverless cars is too dangerous because of the technology. Someone could easily get in the cars system and make it crash or break it in general. If a human was driving, that would not happen because he or she would be in control of the car. The car could also get bugs or viruses like an everyday computer does. With all the technology already in it this could make the car stop working completely. Maybe when the car stopped working the driver was coincidentally asleep or not paying attention. Then they would veer of the road injuring them or someone else. Many people would not be comfortable knowing a car is driving itself when someone could get into it and sabotage it. WIth all this fancy technology in these cars, it will not be very cheap.

It is expensive to make cars today with little technology in them, just imagine all the electronics they would have to put in the driverless cars. That would cost these companies a lot which would make these cars even more expensive for the average people. Adding this to the cost of insurance, everyone would be in debt, just for a little more safety. They say these cars have not crashed yet, but eventually some will. When that happens you will just have to buy another one. Only the very wealthy wouldbe able to afford them. Why spend all this money, when we can do it already?

In dangerous driving situations, nothing can compare to the human mind. Computers do not have emotions or reflexes to veer out of the way. If all these cars come to a four-way stop at the same time, who will know when to go first. Also these cars could not compute with all the drving situations there are. Humans do because we have experience. That is something cars cannot have. We made cars and we have learned how to use them well, why change it? We should keep having humans drive cars.

Instead of spending all this money on safer cars, let's just hit the source and fix the drivers. We could spend money on cracking down on drivers under the influence, stopping texting. If you want to spend money on cars, make one that notices when the driver is texting or has been drinking. We should not spend this money in advances insted of fixing the problem. We should not get driverless cars because the technology people can get is too dangerous, this will cost people loads of money that they need somewhere else, and these cars can't do what humans can do.   ",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"I am against the making of driverless cars. Us as human have been driving for quite a while now, and as they say if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Many people bring up the statistics of car crashes and deaths. What they do not see is that almost all of them are because the driver was impared. They could have been drinking, under the influence of a drug, texting, or distracted by some other object. There should not be driverless cars because it is too dangerous with the technology and hacking there is now, it will also cost millions or even billions of dollars,and in a dangerous situation nothing compares to the human mind. Making these driverless cars is too dangerous because of the technology. Someone could easily get in the cars system and make it crash or break it in general. If a human was driving, that would not happen because he or she would be in control of the car. The car could also get bugs or viruses like an everyday computer does. With all the technology already in it this could make the car stop working completely. Maybe when the car stopped working the driver was coincidentally asleep or not paying attention. Then they would veer of the road injuring them or someone else. Many people would not be comfortable knowing a car is driving itself when someone could get into it and sabotage it. WIth all this fancy technology in these cars, it will not be very cheap. It is expensive to make cars today with little technology in them, just imagine all the electronics they would have to put in the driverless cars. That would cost these companies a lot which would make these cars even more expensive for the average people. Adding this to the cost of insurance, everyone would be in debt, just for a little more safety. They say these cars have not crashed yet, but eventually some will. When that happens you will just have to buy another one. Only the very wealthy wouldbe able to afford them. Why spend all this money, when we can do it already?

Asking what flavors your friends like would make the decision much easier. Asking for multiple opinions can help make a better and easier choice. My three favorite things about getting multiple opinions are that you can get multiple viewpoints, the person that you ask could know more about the topic than you, and it can relieve someones stress. Getting multiple opinions is very important.

One reason getting multiple opinions is important is because you can get different viewpoints. For example, when I was deciding if I should play baseball I asked multiple people so I could get different viewpoints. It helped me make my decision easier. Getting different viewpoints help makes better decisions. Asking multiple people their opinions is always important when making a decision.

Another reason getting different opinions is important is because the person that you ask could know more than you about the topic. One time I was having making a certain shot, so I asked my coach and he helped me start making that shot. Asking him to help me helped me improve my shot. People often know more than me when is comes to sports, so I always make sure to ask for other peoples opinions. My coach always helps me perfect my skills.

A very important reason asking multiple people for their opinions is good is because it helps relieve stress. When I have to make a stressful decision getting different opinions often helps relieve that stress. For example, when I was deciding what kind of gaming computer to get asking my friends for their opinions helped relieve my stress. I believe that stress relief is one of the best parts of getting multiple opinions.

Finally, getting multiple opinions is an important thing to do because it helps make decisions better and easier. I always try to ask for different peoples opinions before I make a choice.

F9FFECDE9A53,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

B33809DC1AAF,"Why is making summer projects student-designed a good option? If teachers created the summer projects, students will not apply it to real life situations if possible, and will also may find no interest in the type of project they are being forced into completing. If summer assignments are student-designed, more students would take an interest and be willing to complete it.

If the summer assignments are student-designed, then they may be more creative based. Students who are able to use creativity may enjoy completing the summer assignment, because they have the ability to use their interests to complete the assignment. For example, if a student needs to complete an assignment on aerodynamics for a science class, and they are interested in how planes work, they could go to an airport, or watch a movie on them. This would work as a student based project because, the student has an interest in airplanes so he would be able to apply his interests to the project assigned. He could find the formula that applies to making planes fly. Another example may be if a student needs to complete a science project on how photosynthesis works. This would work as a student based project because, if the student has an interest in art, they could use their drawing capabilities to their advantage and draw the process of photosynthesis out. Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can use creativity.

If the summer assignments are student-designed, students will be able to brainstorm how they think is best fit to present and/or complete a project. An example of this is if a student is assigned a project from math to find the dimensions of anything, and explain why it is able to stand with those dimensions, they could choose whatever they see fit. This would work as a student based project because, the student has the ability to choose the item of his choice to find the dimensions of after brainstorming what his choice was. Another example of this may be for an art class, where the student is given multiple options to choose from as to what they wish to draw for the assignment. This would work as a student-designed project because, the student has the ability to choose what they want to select, and the assignment is not being forced upon them. Schools should allow the summer assignments to be student-designed, so that the students can have the ability to choose from multiple options as to how they want to complete their project.

Some people may disagree with this opinion. They may say that students need to be told how to do their assignment because otherwise it won't get done. But, if students are given the chance, those people can be proven wrong. Schools should have student-designed summer assignments because, they are independent. An example of this is when a student sees that chores need to be done at home and does them. This is an example because, the student is doing the chores without being told to by a parent or guardian. Another example of this is if a student takes to notice that it is almost time for dinner at their home, and their parents or guardians are running late from work, they begin to prepare dinner so that it is ready when their parents or guardians return home.

When students have the ability to improve on their, creativity, independence and brainstorming skills, it can help them prepare for what the real world will throw at them.

It will not only help them explore their strengths and weaknesses, but also help prepare them for when they graduate from college and get a job. Schools should make the summer assignments student-designed because, it will help improve their creativity, independence, and independent thinking skills (brainstorming skills). In conclusion, students should have the chance to complete student-designed summer assignments rather than teacher-designed.",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"Why is making summer projects studentdesigned a good option?

4EC4EF410FC7,"I do not want to retake this year, but I also do not want to miss my soccer practice. What would I do? If my school made it a requirement to take extra school lessons like sports, yearbooks, or student council would I agree or not. I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed.

Doing the required activities means the activities will give out homework. Many students already have enough homework in their daily bases, and while taking another activity can increase more time on homework and shorten other activities the students would like to enjoy. After school I like taking naps, but if I have lots of homework then I would not be able to do so. Some students may have tests the following day and would like to study for it, but having more homework the student may not study as much as they would like to. In conclusion students already have enough homework and should not have to take extra activities and get more homework.

Many students have activities after school they do on their own time. Some students, like myself, may have more than one activity they are balancing. I have soccer, piano, and swimming that happens every week, and if I take school activities then I would not be able to take my own lessons. When students are required to take school activities their schedule might not have enough time to do the their own activity. If students do not take the required activity they might repeat a year, and many students would not like to retake a hard year. Although there are lots of people who also do not take activities it would be crucial to the kids that do. In conclusion when students take other activities outside of school and are required to take extracurricular activities students would not be able to their own.

If every single student is taking the extracurricular activity that would make the school crowded. When taking other activities it wouldn't be like taking normal school lessons, because there may be more people taking one activity and there would not be enough room for the students. If everyone would take the sports activity the school would not have enough gyms for everyone to go to. In conclusion if a students are required to take extra activities the school would not have enough rooms or activities.

I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed. If the principle decides to do these activities they should let the activities be somewhere outside of school. Allowing the activities not to have homework would also be really helpful.

I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed. Doing the required activities means the activities will give out homework. Many students already have enough homework in their daily bases, and while taking another activity can increase more time on homework and shorten other activities the students would like to enjoy. After school I like taking naps, but if I have lots of homework then I would not be able to do so. Some students may have tests the following day and would like to study for it, but having more homework the student may not study as much as they would like to. In conclusion students already have enough homework and should not have to take extra activities and get more homework. Many students have activities after school they do on their own time. Some students, like myself, may have more than one activity they are balancing. I have soccer, piano, and swimming that happens every week, and if I take school activities then I would not be able to take my own lessons. When students are required to take school activities their schedule might not have enough time to do the their own activity. If students do not take the required activity they might repeat a year, and many students would not like to retake a hard year. Although there are lots of people who also do not take activities it would be crucial to the kids that do. In conclusion when students take other activities outside of school and are required to take extracurricular activities students would not be able to their own. If every single student is taking the extracurricular activity that would make the school crowded. When taking other activities it wouldn't be like taking normal school lessons, because there may be more people taking one activity and there would not be enough room for the students. If everyone would take the sports activity the school would not have enough gyms for everyone to go to. In conclusion if a students are required to take extra activities the school would not have enough rooms or activities. I believe a student should not have to participate in other activities, because students already have enough homework from regular classes and electives, have their own activities after school, and the school would be more packed. If the principle decides to do these activities they should let the activities be somewhere outside of school. Allowing the activities not to have homework would also be really helpful. The school should also make the activities on some days and not everyday so students have other things to do they can do the school activity on another day.

Millions and millions of people drive their car to provide them transportation to get to work, errands, school and little did they know much car usage really effects not only our planet but, ourselves too. Limiting car usage is a very effective way to eliminate stress, lower air pollution, reduce traffic, and save money to make the world a better and healthier place to live.

Two of the many advantages of limiting car usage is it eliminates stress and lowers air pollution. Being stressed is very unhealthy and a simple way to limit your stress is by limiting car usage. A media trainer named Heidrun Walter stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way(Source 1).""

Using other options besides taking a car would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Limiting car usage is a happier life and healthier living.

Saving money and reducing traffic are other advantages of limiting car usage. Traffic is always a problem when trying to get where you need to go.

A7D3E138D9E4,"Some schools require the students to do a project during the summer to assure that the students are still learning during the break. I think that is dumb because the kids are supposed to have a break from school during the summer but i am going to side with the student designed projects. The reason i am siding with student designed is because i am a student myself and I know that students are able to make projects that are fun and still show that They are continuing to learn while they are not at school. One big example of students working on a project they designed is a science project they are not told what to do in it or how to do it by a teacher all they know is decide what to do, then get the materials, then execute the project and then bring it back to school so that goes to show that students can decide what to do for their project. Some people may say that, teachers need to design the students projects so they need to know what to do so they don't get off track but however they are wrong because there are a lot of bright students that don't need a teacher's help with a lot of things and im pretty sure that they don't need help on deciding on something as simple as a project that can be anything that they want.

Schools that don't let the students decide on anything are holding them back on what could be their next future job or career, so schools that let students decide on things are trying to help them reach that potiental so they could decide for themselves on a lot of thing and don't have to have someone tell them they have to do this a certain type of way so at the same time its not just letting them decide on what they want to do for a project they are giving them the freedom to decide what they want to do so when they leave school there is no one that have to tell them what to do every step of the way. But for the schools that have to decide for the students everyday without letting them choose for themselves that is not really helping the students really because when they have to do something by themselves they are going to need someone to coach them through life and show them simple things that could be easily understood but the can't do that be cause in school they had someone to do all deciding for them.

In conclusion, let the students decide their projects so they can do something for themselves and not have the assignment handed to them. The IB personal project can be used for another example of a student designed project. With the IB personal project it takes months because it requires a lot of steps for each individuals project, first you have to plan and decide what you are going to do for that project, second you have to execute the plan and keep up with it so you can write about it, third you have to write a 3000 word paper about the project explaining what you did and how you did it, fourth you have to print out everything you did and put it on a poster board, and finally you have to wait until march 17 for the IB person project fair where you have to present your project to all the family members and friends that will be attending. Some people may say that just because you let students decide what they are goign to do with a project doesn't mean that they wont be depending on someone to help them in life but however they are wrong because that little piece of freedom to decide what they are going to do on a project is getting one step closer to be a self depending person.",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"Some schools require the students to do a project during the summer to assure that the students are still learning during the break.

students should not have to discus all their medical issues with the school. these medical issues that some people have might not let them play in sports or they could struggle with reading. Some medical disorders like down syndrome or dyslexia might be the reason that some people will not play sports. Because they might get sat on the bench during a game, and they could feel left out and that would lead to other medical disorders.

Their parents might say they cant do some sports or activities. Or they think that the school should work on the yearbook, and would prefer their child not to work on in.

Although you might feel comfortable at home,doing your school work from home can be a big distraction rather than doing your work at school. Some schools allow students to attend classes at home but doing than can cause laziness and can be disturbing to the brain. Students should not be allowed to attend classes at home because, students might get more distracted if they do their work from home, students might understand better if their at school, and you can get physical help from your teacher.

To begin with, allowing students to do there class work from home can be distracting. For example, Generic_Name has really good grades and his behavior is astonishing so his counselor and his teacher decided since this was happening he could take his classes from home. Generic_Name and his parents thought this was a great idea until two weeks later when his teacher and parents started to see his grades drop. Generic_Name's parents were beginning to think it was his teachers fault, but it was Generic_Name's fault, he was so distracted by video games and other things he didnt really make time to do his school work. So if Generic_Name would have stayed in school his grades would have looked the same.

Another reason, students might understand better. There are some students who might not understand something, but there to scared or shy to come out and say it. so allowing those who dont really talk to stay at home and take there classes at home what makes you think that they want to be stared at through the computer. For example Generic_Name is a very shy person but she gets her work done. She often struggles with her class work she feels that if she takes her classes through a computer screen it will attract more attention to her an she would be laughed at.

Then, you can get physical help from your teacher. There is nothing wrong with getting help from your teacher, but even then if you take your classes at home how is the teacher going to help you it would be harder for the teacher to because, she might not know what you need help on. You might feel like your going to disturb the class just to ask for help from a computer screen.

2FB9BA37AA3C,"Dear Principal,

I think it is an excellent idea to change the school policy on athletic sports. Many kids do sports, but have bad grades in their classes. I think this is because they are cut low on time to do projects and homework due to their sport practices and games they are required to go to.

Some students can still finish all their work in enough time and go to their after-school sports. Some students may not care about school because they think they will get a scholarship to college through sports. If they can't play sports, they can't get a scholarship. This will force them start working harder so they can get a scholarship.

If you made this policy, it would make some kids concerned and then they will start working harder to get work finished.

Students may not care about some of their grades, but with sports on the line, they may start caring.

Parents will be happy to see that their kids are taking school seriously. Most kids would disagree and argue with you concerning this policy, but in the end they will benefit from it through improved grades. Thank you for doing this; it will really help our school and make our kids happier to see that they will be getting better grades. The students, parents and teachers will be pleased with your decision once it starts affecting everybody in after-school sports. I encourage you to follow through with this policy, I truly believe it will accommodate the school quite nicely.

I think that policy number 2 is a good policy because if you allow students to bring cell phones to school then they will not only use them in lunch or passing periods i think they will be using them in the classrooms too. I think that if you allow them to bring cell phones to school then they would start using them in class too and then they wont be able to learn anything if you allow them to bring them. Also, i think they would be using them all around the school and they don't turn them off they just put them on vibrate or they silent mode them. I think it would be good if they bring cell phones but then they might get too excited then they're going to start using them every time, but i also think some should bring them because sometimes they need to call they're parents after school but sometimes they could get out of hand. They can also be prank call people or they can cyber bully someone and i know that, that wont be good for our school. They wont be learning anything if you allow them to bring cell phones because maybe when they are taking test they text each other the answers or tell each other to help. I mean bringing cell phones isn't bad but what would the consequences be if you let them bring they're cell phones? Well i think some of the consequences can be they can get lower grades, they can cheat, they can be using them in class or even cyber bully someone! I don't think they should because they will be using them all around the school and that will be a bad thing.

sincerely,

nevertheless the electoral colleges dispute over its outcome is possible, it also nrequires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, its winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes does induce the candidates, the electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed on the constition, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

the electoral college method of selecting the president is and will turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished.

A827D5DE2309,"When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.

A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.

When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.

Not everyone will agree to this,and the majority will stick to electoral college because if been working for us since the 1800.

Like in 2012 when obama and romney were running obama won because he new that people want a winner take all basis. Obama got 61% of electorla votes and Romney got 51%.Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winners take all basis the state creates a landslide electoral vot victory in that state.

The electoral college reguires a presidential candidate to have regional appeal. Not one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Romney was from the south so people in their voted for him. But people up north thought that would be greedy and our nation needs a president for all. It was a situation that he would only apply or do anything for the south but nothing for the north. So candidates with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president.

The winner takes all method focuses their campaign efforts on the toss up states. People in the toss up state are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide who gets elected.

BED647C69EDF,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferring. In my opinion, those students have more benefit than the others one who attend to a regular school. A regular has a lot of students, and they don't have the time to meet all of their students. However, to attend classes from home is a better idea to those students who don't like to be around of others. To illustrate: no distractions in class, better vocabulary, and choose our time.

To begin with, many students in school are noisy and they distract the class, and our learning too. If we stay at home working in our classes we're going to learn more, because we're focus in what we need to do, and follow the instructions. Sometimes teachers stop the class because other student is playing with their phones or talking with their friends, that's disrespectful for the people who wants to learn. We want to concentrate in our work, or in what we are working on it. That's why is better to take classes at home and working in silent, and in your own privacy.

In addiction, to live out of the city will helps our education, because we don't have to came to the big city to don't learn much as we can learn in our village or in our home. Most of the people who live around the city is less educational then the people who live in rural areas, in the street we only heard bad words, and student learn that, but if we stay at home we're can not learn those words. This happen not only in the streets this happen also in schools too, because some students create their own vocabulary by the new singers. They feel that they looks cool, but the reality is those new singer are losing this new generation, most of the students in high school repeat everything.

Finally, I'm one of person who likes to be at home helping mom when I want; clean the home, and sleep most of the time, sometime I feel myself as a couch of potato, because I wake up and I don't want to do it nothing just continuous sleeping. If we take class online we can choose our own schedule, wake up late, sometimes don't take shower and open the computer to learn new materials. Also, when we don't want to keep working just do something else. In regular school we have to wake up early, sometimes the bus left us, we have to wait of the next one, nevertheless we're late to our first class. In home we will never late we are not going to stress our self thinking that we're going to lose half of the class.

To conclude, more schools should offer those benefits to study online, because we can be safe of some crazy person who want to shooting a school we are not going to be there to suffer that terrible accident if we stay at home. The're a lot of good things to choose study at home, and not going to schools. Some reasons are: learn more, everyday take one different class, going what we really need to do.

However, students will enjoy this programs because they will want to have their own time to study, and pay attention to everything without any distration of other noisy student.  ",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferring. In my opinion, those students have more benefit than the others one who attend to a regular school. A regular has a lot of students, and they don't have the time to meet all of their students. However, to attend classes from home is a better idea to those students who don't like to be around of others. To illustrate no distractions in class, better vocabulary, and choose our time. To begin with, many students in school are noisy and they distract the class, and our learning too. If we stay at home working in our classes we're going to learn more, because we're focus in what we need to do, and follow the instructions.

However,teachers projects are the outline to assist the students for success. Teachers are there to educate the student through everything ""I'm here to train you, not hurt you"" from Jackie Chan(Karate Kid). The training is like the summer project to start the foundation for the future. Teachers formulate an effective summer project for the students because, they're reliable, preparation for the future, and introduce an formidable task. Freedom is quite important to everyday life, so why not in projects as well.

Firstly, the students have freedom in their projects. Students could pick topics that interest them to formulate a project into it. Students could relate to ""now I do what I want""(Lil Uzi).The song is quite literal to the freedom for the project. The freedom aspects is very uncommon in assignments, during summer usually students would have to read a book of the teachers choice and write an essay about it. Students having a choice and freedom is unique to choose there own project. A student with special skills could demonstrate there talents and natural abilities.

Secondly, the students are allowed to express their creativity. Students with skills set could demonstrate their talent in there project. For example a student that is good with technology could add effects to the project and have no limitations from the teacher. Students are like magicians ""magicians don't reveal there tricks""(Inspection) every student could have a skill set that they're not showing which is why they're like magicians. Students that are able to demonstrate there creativity is game changing in there project. Theres a saying that time is the foundation of life.

Thirdly, the students convince for the project is very important. Students can complete there project anywhere he or she goes. Average students tend to go on trips during the summer to explore and create family bonding. While they're on the trip they could also complete there project because it's in there own rules and convince. Students value there summer vacation time so convince doing the project is very important. ""you have to treat time wisely""(One Piece) students wouldn't want to miss a trip because of a project that there teacher assigned, so students would prefer the convince to do there project when ever and where ever.

Finally, students would appreciate to demonstrate what they're best at, there time over the summer break, and express what ever they want.

Does it feel like if you want to get any where you have drive in a car because it's to far to walk? Cars are our main source of transportation but it is not helping our environment. Gas that is used in cars send off green house gas emissions that hurt the ozone layer, a layer of gas in the stratosphere that protects us from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Many cities have started becoming car free because of this harm to the environment.

One of the cities that has become car free is Vauban, Germany Source 1. This city has found a way to become car free so that it is good for the environment and people can still go to stores or their jobs. What this city does is they make suburbs more compact and make store easily a walk away from a store. It mentions in Source 1 that Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions. In the United states it is at 50%. All those green house emissions put a hole in the ozone layer making it hotter around the world and letting the ultraviolet rays from the sun hit our body which can cause skin cancer. The design of Vauban is used to structure other cities allowing those cities to use less cars.

The acumilation of smog can be very dangerous. in Source 2 in talks about Paris having to ban driving due to the amount of smog in city. The people driving would be fined 22 euro. The congestion of the smog dropped 60% because of the ban on driving. Source 2 states that France uses diesel fuel instead of regular gasoline due to a tax policy. Diesel makes up 67% percent of vehicles in France. Diesel fuel is harsher than regular gasosline to the ozone layer because it uses different chemicals and burns quicker than regular gasoline.

In Source 4 it talks about the United States using less cars than normal. In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person dropped by 9 percent compared to the past. It also states that the amount of young people driving has dropped 23% between 2001 and 2009. This drop in amount of people driving is very good due to green house gas emissions being the second largest source behind power plants. This drop in cars driven also causes less harm to the ozone layer. Source 4 also says that because of technology and the internet people do not have to drive to see and speak with each other. Instead they can email, call, or text each other.

To conclude, with people driving less cars it becomes better for the environment. It allows less smog to build up and hurt the ozone layer allowing ultraviolet rays to harm us. Cities will be designed differently to acomdate the fact of using less cars by making jobs and stores closer to houses.",train_essays,0,0.0,"Has it ever seem hotter than it usually has to you?

D5DCB665A2A2,"Seeking multiple opinions when making a difficult choice can be beneficial because the decision maker will see many perspectives, Others may have more experience than the decision maker, and asking more than one person will help to eliminate any false or non-beneficial advice.

When faced with any decision one will always have a specific opinion or view of the topic at hand. For some it is hard to move past their beliefs and see the other side of the story. For example, If a person refuses to see other perspectives, their stubbornness could lead to the wrong decision and a path that that could have been avoided if they had been more open-minded. Talking to multiple people and being open-minded can help one see many different perspectives and can sway them to one side or the other. After seeing all the sides to the story it will be much easier to make that important decision, so when faced with a difficult decision always look to many people to make the right choice.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can be beneficial to making the right decision is because other people may have more experience. If one were to only receive advice from a single person the chances of that person having the right experience to give good advice are low. For example , Generic_Name's car needs an oil change. Generic_Name asks all of his friends if they know any good mechanics. One of Generic_Name's friends happened to know the best mechanic in the area. Asking lots of people until he found the best advice from the most experienced person helped Generic_Name make the best choice. This same strategy can be applied to a number of different stuations much more important than an oil change.

Lastly, talking to multiple people can help eliminate non-beneficial advice. Advice that is not beneficial or even harmful to ones decision making process could be given out by accident by a less experienced individual. Just like how some people hove lots of experience some have little. This problem can be avoided by simply talking to more people because non-beneficial advice will stand out in contrast to the more rational and well thought out advice. A strategy that will help to lessen the amount of harmful advice is to seek out advice from people that are known to have more experience. This way the majority of feedback that is received will be very beneficial, making unwanted advice that much more distinguishable.

In conclusion, When searching for advice talk to lots of people and consider their opinions while keeping an open mind. Also, Talk to lots of people to find the individuals that have the most experience and can give the very best advice. once again, Talk to lots of people in order to identify the advice that could lead one to make the wrong decision.

F5D2D8C81370,"Cellphones should be allowed because that might help students to communicate with their parents if they have any kind of emergency while they are in school. It would be helpful for students to find any kind of information on internet when they forget their computers or other devices that they might use as a resource to find information. Another reason is that students will have the advantage to use their cellphones while they are in the middle of the class, and it means that those schools trust students that they use their cellphones properly during class and they are proving to others schools that student can be trusted to use their cellphones during classes. Students also can give an example to other students that cellphones are little machines that help us in everyday lives, and they also might be giving advice to students in how they can be benefited from chance that the school provides to them.

On the other side why cellphones should not be allowed in schools is because schools think that students will not use their cellphones in a right path, and they will become more addictive to their cellphones where social media it's included. Most of the population have shown that a big percent of the population use their cellphones to spend their time in social media, whether is Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram. Another percent of the population spend their time in YouTube which that YouTube brings us some advantage and disadvantage. The advantage might be the tutorials that can help us to find information, how to fix something that you are capable to repair, and how to provide some skills from something that you like. The disadvantage might be that people might spend too much time watching video games or a new episodes from their favorite comics characters. Another reason to not use cellphones in school is because when there is a fight between two students, they start to take pictures or videos of the fight rather than prevent and called anyone who can help.

Most of the student will agree to have cellphones in schools because some of them use their cellphones in a right path and some of them do not. For those who use their cellphones in a properly way will say that cellphones are going to help them more than what teachers expect. Some of this students also will help them to find whatever meaning of a word that they do not understand. There are going to be some students who speak different language as their first language and it is very helpful to have cellphone while they are in school. For example some of the students who speak Spanish and they do not understand what the word say, they directly go to their cellphones and translate the word. Then they start to use it in some sentences to challenge themselves and improve their English. Those students who agree to have cellphones in school and do not accomplish the rules in how to use their cellphones properly, they will be playing around while they are in class, listen to music, and probably they will be texting with their friends. For some students will be annoying to have cellphones in class because it is going to be a distraction even if they are not using their cellphones.

From other perspective teachers might believe that is wrong to have cellphones in class, whether they are using it in a proper way or not because they might believe that it's a distraction for every students, and even if they are good students they will use their cellphones while teachers are explaining some important information. They also believe that some of them will use their cellphones to finish homework that is not for their class and will cause that students will not be paying attention in what the teacher is saying. Teachers also say that students will be texting in class and some of them playing video games and then when they tell them to put their cellphones away, they do not obey and some of them insult the teacher. Some teacher do not bother them if a student have a cellphone or not because they think that as long the student is doing his homework and classwork, they are going to be fine.

I believe cellphones should be allowed in schools, but under supervision of the teachers and principles. One of the reason why I believe that should be allowed is because cellphones are very useful and helpful for me in many ways. In my situation I speak Spanish as my first language and when I do not understand a word I go to my cellphone and I translate the word and then I try to understand what the word means. I also use my cellphone when I do not have my computer with me, and I do my classwork with my cellphone, and then I turn my work in. But some students do not understand when they have to use their cellphones and when I see students listening to music it does distracted me because I am trying to concentrate in what the teachers is explaining because If I don not pay attention it is hard to understand later on. I also see how teachers get mad when a student do not obey when they have to put their cellphones away, and then the student start to argue with the teacher.

But some students do not understand when they have to use their cellphones and when I see students listening to music it does distracted me because I am trying to concentrate in what the teachers is explaining because If I don not pay attention it is hard to understand later on. I also see how teachers get mad when a student do not obey when they have to put their cellphones away, and then the student start to argue with the teacher. I strongly agree that school should allow students to have cellphones because it does provide a lot of advantages.",19.115331649780273,18.623268127441406,18.623268127441406

Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. To back up my reasoning here are 3 reasons as to why you should consider voting against the electoral college. Segregationists replacing voters of one candidate for another, the election could become a catastrophe if a tie were to happen, there is a chance of a ""disaster factor"" happening.

Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44 Imagine if the corrupter had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the system works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should.

Some people claim an electoral tie is impossible, but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn't seem so bad lets take a look at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. Plumer, P. 12, line 80 The election is really only a few swing voters away from catastrophe, and possibly, the worst government shutdown these United States have ever seen. So, if 41,971 voters from 1968 didn't seem like alot, then lets look at the 9,246 voters from 1976, ties are seemingly getting closer and closer, what will happen when it is too late?

There is always the off chance of a ""disaster factor"" occuring, like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office.

Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another ""disaster factor"" were to happen again.

These are the 3 reasons as to why i believe you should consider voting against using the electoral college.

575107B10B0B,"Dear State Senator,

The one word used throughout this whole article ; catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular soverignty, should be just  that ; decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to voters/interested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country. The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterized by popular vote because of TWO main reasons:it does

NOT

allow for a simple method of voting, and it does

NOT

allow for every vote, and voice to be heard in the United States presidency election, tarnishing this countrys' right of democracy, causing outrages all over the country.

To initialize this one-sided argument, lets begin with an important factor that the electoral college cannot be trusted on achieving, the fact that every vote counts. With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register ""Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like  how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.

Theories on how a single vote doesn't matter have been given, as stated in Par. 23 Source 3 by Richard A. posner ""Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."", who also comes to contradict themselves originally with ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% Percent plurality"". In that instance, that one vote could've made a HUGE difference on our future. On top of that, so many voices in states that arent swing states (States that could go democratic or republican, and aren't fixated on only 1 party) that have been silenced could add up to be a tremendous amount of 'single votes', changing this nations history drastically.

Furthermore onto this argument ; one thing is known as a world wide factor that applies to almost everything that we do. Simpler, is better. If you take your precious time and read all Par. 1-8 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely over-afflictionated method is used when determining our next president.  Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people.

Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting. Key knowledge that must be analyzed is that: just because a service is organized, does NOT mean its correct. Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how ""The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century; the system allows for much worse."" and ""that those elctors could always defy the will of the people."" in Par. 9 ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al-Gore-Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote.

To summarize, and simplify (what should be done with our voting ways) this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.

7157D835228A,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME.

Today i am here to talk to you about our cell phone policy here at school. Everyone has there different opinion on it. I'm writing this to tell you mine.

My opinion is that we should be allowed to have our phones in school, and use them during lunch, or free times, but have them off in class. i think if we do this students will, or should have them off in class cause we get to us them any other time. if they do have them on in class, this privilege should be taken away. As a student, I would use my phone during lunch, and free periods. when I'm in a class, or not allowed to use it, i wouldn't use it because we can already use it at another time, and if we want to still be able to use our phones in school, i would not use it when I'm not supposed too.

Reason's why we should be able to have our phones in school:

- some students walk home, or ride a bus, in case of emergency, we need phones to contact someone.

- If allowed, to use phones, during free times, students wouldn't be up walking around, yelling across the room, and just be wild. we could text that person, and talk to them that way instead.

- if we earned the right to have our phones in school, we should be able to have them.

one problem would be, not being concentrated in class. i think that as long as you tell them they have to keep there grades up, and earn it, they can have phones. if only a few students haven't earned the right to have there phone in school, they can't have it.

things student's have to do to earn it:

- keep grades up.

- get good grades on test / quizzes.

- be responsible.

- don't get in trouble.

- do what your told.

- no punishments at home.

- listen to parents.

if all goes well, we should be able to have our phones. if it would become a problem, and was not working, it should be taken away. if a student is caught with there phone in class, they should get it taken away, a parent should have to come pick it up, and they can' t use there phone is school anymore. if they proceed to do so, it would get taken away, a referral should be given, along with detention, a phone call home, and a parent would have to pick it up again. thank you for taking the time to read this. i ask you to please take this into consideration.

thank you once again.

My experience there was very unique and full of adventures. I made a lot of animal friends. I would recommend this trip to anyone who likes to travel and likes to take care of animals.

One reason you people would like to go there is because there are a lot of animals there. Some of them including horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. So, if you like animals, you should join Seagoing Cowboys.

Another reason you should go there is because as a Seagoing Cowboy, I have traveled overseas many times and the reason is because of cattle boat trips. I have went on them nine times. I have also seen Europe and China. Although, seeing the Acropolis in Greece was a special visit for me. Also taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with a lot of water. I also toured a castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. So that is another reason I enjoyed joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Last but not the least, I loved when we played games. We usually played after the animals were unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. We also played Table-tennis, fencing, boxing. We read too, these were all the things we did to help pass time.

I hope that when some of you join Seagoing Cowboys, you have as much fun as I did and hopefully you return safe and sound from Seagoing Cowboys. Thank you very much for considering to join Seagoing Cowboys!

0A2EE9B6BF75,"With the rise of technology in schools, many questions arise.

One major question is, would students benefit more from an online classroom setting, and video conference classes.

Or would they benefit more from a normal classroom setting.

I believe that most students would benefit more in a regular classroom setting, because the atmosphere in a normal classroom is completely different from one online, students also learn better with hands on learning and training.

Lastly, it seems for many of my classmates, including myself, that it is much easier to get work done for an ""in school"" class.

Being in a real classroom is completely different from an online classroom in many ways.

I can tell you from experience being in a real classroom has benefited me in lots of ways.

I've faced and overcome my fear of public speaking in a real classroom.

I've also always been the one to retaliate when someone makes me mad, but being in a classroom with other students that pick on you and mess with you has taught me that not everyone and everything needs a response.

I would dare say that being in a classroom setting has made me more mature, and has prepared me for the future.

Although some students do well with passive learning; I believe most students do best by learning with hands on activities.

I once read an article that had a statistic in it saying that 70 percent of students learn better with hands on activities.

Where only 30 percent learned better with passive learning.

Online classes prevent students from learning with hands on activities.

I am in an AP Statistics class this year, and I do best when the teacher shows us what to do.

I often do worse when he just gives us steps to follow, and then tells us to complete the task.

I would also say that my fellow classmates agree with me.

In my history class, my teacher often teaches in a passive way.

He tells us what happened and doesn't give us worksheets or classwork to do.

He stands up at the front of the classroom the entire class period, tells us about the certain unit we are on, then at the end of the period he gives us a homework assignment that we have to complete.

I feel like that is much of online learning is like, and I can tell you that most of the kids in my class don't do well with that type of learning.

Getting work done for online classes is much harder compared to a classroom setting.

In some online courses you don't have to do your classwork by a certain time of the day.

You just have to have it done by a certain day of the week.

I know how I procrastinate and how my classmates do the same thing, and I think being in a real classroom provides more motivation to get work done and succeed in the class.

It is also easier to review past concepts from previous classes in a classroom setting compared to an online classroom, because in real a classroom you can interact with other students and bring ideas to the teacher to review.

In online classes you may not always be able to do that.

To conclude, I do believe that some students learn better passively, but I also believe more students learn better in a classroom setting with hands on activities.

Students benefit from building relationships with their teachers, which turn into their mentors.

Students learn better by working together in groups, and in return that teaches them to work better with other people.

Finally, being enrolled in an normal classroom provides more motivation for students to get their work done, and succeed in the class, which at the end of the day is the whole point of taking the class right?",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"With the rise of technology in schools, many questions arise.

I've also always been the one to retaliate when someone makes me mad, but being in a classroom with other students that pick on you and mess with you has taught me that not everyone and everything needs a response. I would dare say that being in a classroom setting has made me more mature, and has prepared me for the future. Although some students do well with passive learning I believe most students do best by learning with hands on activities. I once read an article that had a statistic in it saying that 70 percent of students learn better with hands on activities. Where only 30 percent learned better with passive learning. Online classes prevent students from learning with hands on activities. I am in an AP Statistics class this year, and I do best when the teacher shows us what to do. I often do worse when he just gives us steps to follow, and then tells us to complete the task. I would also say that my fellow classmates agree with me. In my history class, my teacher often teaches in a passive way. He tells us what happened and doesn't give us worksheets or classwork to do. He stands up at the front of the classroom the entire class period, tells us about the certain unit we are on, then at the end of the period he gives us a homework assignment that we have to complete. I feel like that is much of online learning is like, and I can tell you that most of the kids in my class don't do well with that type of learning. Getting work done for online classes is much harder compared to a classroom setting. In some online courses you don't have to do your classwork by a certain time of the day. You just have to have it done by a certain day of the week. I know how I procrastinate and how my classmates do the same thing, and I think being in a real classroom provides more motivation to get work done and succeed in the class. It is also easier to review past concepts from previous classes in a classroom setting compared to an online classroom, because in real a classroom you can interact with other students and bring ideas to the teacher to review. In online classes you may not always be able to do that. To conclude, I do believe that some students learn better passively, but I also believe more students learn better in a classroom setting with hands on activities. Students benefit from building relationships with their teachers, which turn into their mentors. Students learn better by working together in groups, and in return that teaches them to work better with other people. Finally, being enrolled in an normal classroom provides more motivation for students to get their work done, and succeed in the class, which at the end of the day is the whole point of taking the class right?",17.193099975585938,13.90858268737793,13.90858268737793

Also, sometime is cause that they are sick ,and can't attend to the school for any problem. This classes online or video conferencing would help the student to pass the class and save the year from home.

First, the students missing a lot classes in the end of the year. They need a opportunities to pass the classes, because when we are in the 12 grade sometime we need two o more extra classes for our graduation. Also we missing classes in the end of the year, because we feel tired to go school and work everyday. Sometimes we missing classes for the reason that we come late to this country, so we need more classes for the graduation. I think that in my country we don't have this opportunities to save our year from home, because we don't have this technology.

Second, if the students have a problem at home or they are sick. If they can't come to the school. I think that students are working, because they need to pay the rent and help their families. Also, when they move to a new high school, and your consul talk to you that you need to pay for two classes; if you wanna graduate this year. I think is hard to listen this year wasn't your graduation this year, because in your old high school don't take all classes. For this reason, we need the classes online at home and video conferencing.

Third, the video conferencing and online classes is wonderful for many students. This is a medium where the student can save the year, and your grades don't go down. Then this benefit a lot students that want overcome in your studies. Also, we can't fail with our class. Today, in actually we have this method for student that really try to take more classes.

The end, the classes online and video conferencing is a biggest benefit, that we have in the high school. The student need help in each grade, because they want to getting the number of classes that are requirement for your graduation or for your college. If we want to learning more about a subject; we can getting a class online or a video conferencing. However, this medium benefit the people outside too.  ",persuade_corpus,0,0.0,"Yes, i am agree with this, because some student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
